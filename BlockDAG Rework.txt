Vesting Must Be Completely Re-Worked
EDIT *********Look guys I can already see y’all are missing what I’m requesting, I want you to come up with a complete comprehensive plan from your perspective not just little thoughts, your little thoughts are OK, but this is the most important thing we’ve ever done as it pertains to this project, spend 10 hours on this shit, come up with some real comprehensive solutions**********
For us to have any kind of successful launch with $32 million as liquidity, we must rework the entire vesting structure from the ground up. This is something I am going to work on. I know there are a lot of smart people in here who have a full understanding of what is going on. Let’s say there are between 16 and 18 billion base coins. That puts 32 to 34 billion bonus coins. It has been said that we lock the bonus coins for a year and have a linear release over the following 12 months. That would mean that the plan was to have the base coins, fully released by the end of the first 12 months. Then we have to factor in the X 30s won’t be here for a couple three months, the X 100s and X tens will follow, those are deliverables that could boost price, ￼but we need to factor x1 miners and how many will actually migrate by having to buy 7,500BDAG, and 20BDAG/DAY from those, x10s at 200BDAG/day x30s and 600/day and x100s and 2000 per day once all hooked up and delivered, as well as when to begin the linear digression of mining rewards based on network difficulty. We need multiple scenarios, one way the vesting schedule based on mainnet launch and coin listing before equipment is delivered, and one way to launch amd list after all promised hardware is delivered and in operation. There are many more caveats that I’m not mentioning, but essentially from my preliminary evaluation we will only be able to release a tiny fraction of the coins if we lost before hardware is delivered, and our vesting may be better to be based on DAO decisions for more coins to be unlocked and for it to take much longer to release the entire 50b from the presale. I need smart people to help me croudsource ideas for this to be a successful launch in many scenarios, if you create document email them to me at
