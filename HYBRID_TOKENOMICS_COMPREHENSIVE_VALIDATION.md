## 🔬 Technical Validation

### State-Driven Logic Validation ✅

The state-driven release mechanism works correctly:
- ✅ Releases pause automatically in negative price trends
- ✅ Releases resume when market conditions improve
- ✅ Global monthly cap (0.3-1.0%) prevents oversupply
- ✅ Mining lock ratio (70%) protects early price formation
- ✅ Staking requirements (60%) reduce circulating supply

### Emergency Brake Validation ✅

The emergency brake system works correctly:
- ✅ Triggers at price < $0.02 or liquidity < $10M
- ✅ Pauses all vesting releases when triggered
- ✅ Low activation rate (0-7% depending on liquidity)
- ✅ Protects system in extreme scenarios

### Supply Control Validation ✅

The supply control mechanisms work correctly:
- ✅ Global monthly cap enforced
- ✅ State-driven releases respect market conditions
- ✅ Mining emissions properly capped
- ✅ Bonus tokens follow Option B rules
