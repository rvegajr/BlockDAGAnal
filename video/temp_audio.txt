Okay, Jens, we should be live now.
So, well, welcome, everyone.
Good to have you here again.
AMA number 13.
We're starting to pick up a bit of momentum on the numbering,
so that's great.
I think everyone probably agrees that these weekly AMA's are.
They're a very successful, they're a nice way of interacting
with community on a regular basis.
I keep saying we'll keep them but shorter,
but they do seem to end up over the hours,
so we'll see.
I've got time.
So, as long as needed for a community.
Yeah, so welcome to everyone.
And thanks to Read and Mohammed for joining me as well.
Obviously, they have representing yourselves with community
and the blockchain investor group.
So, we appreciate you being on with me today.
I appreciate your time and I think this,
the format of this works well.
I think community is also appreciating it as well.
So, I'd like to keep this going.
Keep the nice and dynamic.
Give you a chance to ask for questions.
And at the end, if there's time,
then we'll also do see take more questions from the community,
but I know Read and Mohammed have already got
the potential questions that they want to take us through.
And we've got quite a few people here, I'm just seeing.
Yeah, I think most not many more people joining,
so I think let's kick off.
In contrast to previous sessions,
I haven't got any slides prepared.
I can always refer back to others,
but this is really just a question or answer session.
So, I'm going to hand over actually
straight to Read and Mohammed to Darwin.
And yeah, start with any questions you've got.
Well, I guess I'm going to start out with a statement.
And that was, we had mentioned a couple of weeks ago,
I think we really started on the 24th of October.
We had AMA and we had alluded to the transitioning
from Gerhand Kieselos operating this pre-sale
through W Pro.
And that all be transitioned over to you
that you were kind of operating as a project manager
for the development of the blockchain
and building the team for that,
but finances and everything else
are being controlled out of your hands.
And so, you know, we had stopped
on a lot of the marketing things that had been happening.
And then I believe it was Monday morning.
They came out with a 128 million dollar,
or I'm sorry, 128 million token,
freebie giveaway type of situation.
And it just inside of the community.
I woke up that morning and it was explosive.
And, you know, the community reacted
and W Pro decided to pull that promotion
and so that's gone.
And then they came out with a, you know,
more tech-based release.
And I have to say that the release was better.
It was really what the community was looking for
and had been looking for for a long time.
You know, it was March when you said that
we were going to stop with the bonuses
and where somehow overruled at some point
within that.
And that's really when people started saying
we need to change how all this is working.
And so I'm just kind of want to start there
and because the question around the whole community
is when is this transition going to take place?
Where we're absolutely fed up
with the,
uh,
uh,
our hand keys a low methodology of pre-sale running
and we want you to take over, Anthony.
Okay, well,
so I think just as a recap,
so yeah, as you said,
two weeks ago,
we had the AMA where
I was looking for threat
in terms of my role.
My area is a responsibility
and control and visibility.
And I think that was sort of the turning point.
Prior to that,
we'd announced that the bonuses would stop.
I think that was an important,
an important step towards
creating the wrongs of the past.
Um,
we're in a transition.
These things do take time.
I know I've had a lot of people asking me sort of
what why is it taking so long.
Um,
it's a big project.
A lot of people involved.
Um,
it doesn't happen overnight.
Um,
this stuff.
Happening daily with teams that have
have jobs to do and processes to follow.
So,
this is a process.
It's going to take some time.
We also have to set structures up.
Um,
some of that.
We can't transition to
a structure that doesn't exist.
We can't transition to people who
on their to take over responsibility.
So,
we busy planning what roles we need.
Um,
I mean,
obviously our.
The plans around the marketing.
We'll require a different type of team.
So we don't have to gear up in the same way that.
Or to replicate the team that's there currently.
But we do need to gear up.
We don't have a big marketing team.
It's pretty small at the moment.
We need to keep positions.
We need to fill.
We need to,
which we've started.
We've planned the structure.
We've received sort of moving towards getting that set up.
So all of that will take time.
And I think it's important that people just recognise that.
It's not going to happen overnight.
I said by the end of the year.
Um,
And that's I think reasonable.
So I know everyone wants things fixed yesterday.
I'm trying to do that.
Um,
but as you've seen,
I mean,
things are taking longer.
Um,
as in transition across them.
I mean, that's moving run,
obviously in the same way about the same team.
Um,
just.
In terms of that promo that went out,
uh, the competition.
Um,
I mean,
I think it was.
The committee showed you nice of front.
They were quick to react.
And for the first time,
they're the project also listened to the community.
So I mean,
that was probably a unique,
a unique time in the project's life.
When it actually responded quickly to the community.
So that's positive in itself.
Um,
I mean,
I think that the competition shouldn't have gone out in the first place,
because it was,
uh,
it could be,
we could have guessed that it would have had that reaction,
but nevertheless to say,
to go out,
but it was cool.
I mean,
that's, that's a little bit of,
a little bit of positivity in,
in a,
in a negative sort of,
um,
action.
Um,
sorry,
I've lost my train of thought a bit in terms of what specific
question I've just sort of rambling on a little bit of art sort of,
the transition we're in.
Just,
I think it's important also as I know people,
a couple of people have now managed or emailed saying,
why am I not stopping this,
you're in charge now,
what's happening?
And I think just to make it clear,
I'm not in charge yet.
Um,
I wish I were,
but part of the transition is to move things over.
So as soon as I take over things,
I think everyone will hopefully see the difference.
Um,
if they don't go in,
they'll see the difference and I'll certainly make it clear,
uh,
where the control lies.
So once we take over anything,
I'll make it clear,
but right now,
um,
not much has moved over,
but the plans are in place,
and they are,
and we are working through things.
Long those lines,
Anthony,
I think,
um,
you know,
the last problem I'll just piggy off of what we said is,
that was just ridiculous.
We had an entire AME before that talking about the marketing,
is garbage and right off to that.
They've just hunched it and just ran with it.
Uh,
I'm trying to compliment what goes on in marketing.
You have bonuses being a problem,
tokenomics out of control.
And you're putting a hundred and twenty-eight million points out there.
When you don't even know what you're going to do with your base,
customer is their bonus points.
It doesn't make sense.
And as a community,
it shouldn't have even taken all of us to pull that down.
Common sense should have dictated that.
Before that,
probably even went out there.
So the community as a whole,
they've all been making demands that while the transition is going on,
they still want you to be involved in the marketing.
He still want those to come through you as part of the transition.
So is that something that could happen while the transition is ongoing itself?
Um,
I think the word transition actually means that it can happen,
because that implies a slow movement of involvement and oversight.
Um,
so already there's some discussions around sort of taking,
pricing, marketing, messaging,
and primers and anything like that through through myself just to,
to get the OK.
And that was actually,
it was actually discussed prior to all of this around the meekest side of things,
because obviously from a meekest perspective we have to be more careful.
Um,
now things have changed and that meekest more important in the new structures.
So we're not that worried about the old structure we've,
we've missed the boat in terms of meeker compliance there.
And then we, we, we so far down,
we so far into them,
the precell that's,
it's not relevant,
but the conversation was around meeker that those need to be at least approved,
so they don't go up with misleading wording.
So I'm trying to get that in place,
and hopefully the sooner the batch,
then that'll make a difference at least we can make sure that the wording is not misleading,
and accurate with clear,
um,
authentic,
and hopefully starts circling or centering more around the tech and the delivery is opposed to just the hype that we've seen in the past.
Well,
I'm sorry,
not a clear answer,
but it's certainly my intention to try and make that happen.
Well, you know what,
like Mohammed said,
um,
over sale was not just a slight amount,
it was extensive.
It was,
um,
oversold by double the amount of what the,
um,
um,
precell was supposed to be,
I think we said be oversold by like a hundred million or something like that.
Well,
I guess there were a hundred million and bonus coins,
and there was only,
uh,
I'm sorry,
I said million,
and I met billion.
There was only 50 billion a lot in from the get go,
so this all ties back into a seat,
um,
sorry,
a CFO,
you know,
you had said that we don't currently have a CFO that you had reached out and tried to hire one,
um,
I don't know,
11,
some odd months ago,
and then that never took place,
and that essentially,
um,
I mean,
for lack of a better understanding,
uh,
W Pro and
on Kieselo has been operating as the financial,
um,
has had financial control.
So,
are we going to continue to let,
uh,
let him operate and whatever manner that he's operating,
or we actively trying to get a CFO,
to evaluate the state of the presale and all of that,
so,
um,
we can actually address the tokenomics and a proper manner,
with somebody who knows what they're doing.
So,
the plan is to have a CFO in place,
as soon as possible in a new structure,
um,
certainly by,
called it by the end of the year,
given where we are,
um,
it's obviously,
it,
that person will have no oversight,
to impact on,
where,
on the existing structure,
um,
so,
and...
yeah,
I mean,
that's the best,
that's the best we can sort of...
the best,
this I can provide in terms of this transition,
is making sure that we move to a structure that has the right people in place.
So we're going to make sure I got it correct.
So,
essentially,
as it currently sits,
um,
like I said,
I guess W Pro is kind of handling all the marketing and finances and stuff like that,
and then,
when that's transitioned over,
over you'll be able to start from that point and start operating with some compliance and fiscal
responsibility. You know we've seen the leaked or whatever the screenshot of unpaid
invoices for various sponsors and you know I know that we've had the F1 sponsorship with Alpine
you know it's all that up to date and has that been paid you know are we paying our bills?
Yeah so just to confirm your first points I think what what we're aiming for is to move to
compliance structure and with the right people in place in the right processes and the right controls.
Okay thank you. Yeah. Can you present any of your frozen?
I think we lost time. Yeah we both see so yeah essentially that's something that definitely
needs to be taken care of mom it. I know that the finances are you know along with transition
is the the number one priority at this point. I guess our there we go. Sorry we lost you about
regulatory compliance and getting back into compliance with the pre-sale and as we move forward.
Okay so that wasn't one of these cases where you have one of these phone calls and you don't
want to you don't want to speak to someone so you go losing you. Yeah that wasn't the case so yeah just
just to confirm it's most certainly the plan will move to a compliance structure with all the controls
in place including CFO and the right financials in place. Obviously I can't comment on where it's
coming from and the current structures. In terms of the transition we'll receive the funds.
Again we haven't the accounts will need to be done and those will need to be provided to us
as part of that transfer then we need to understand what we're getting and and how they made up
and obviously and and we know there'll be a gap between the raise and funds transferred because
obviously I mean there are a lot of expenses it's an expensive project to run. What that gap is I'm
not sure and obviously once we get those we need to understand we need to be given
paperwork that explains that and we can see whether the spend is gone. It's yeah and and we'll
probably I mean we'll be we'll be taking a fast value whatever we give we given and we will do
what we can to interrogate and make sure that it looks reasonable and and holds up but more than that
I mean I can't comment I don't know what it looks like I'm not sure what format we'll get with it
what is it I know what it is management accounts and not sure. Among those lines and the reason why
our communities are concerned about funding is in disdising to go ahead and WPRO
and prior projects and how do we manage so there have been a lot of questions surrounding
big eyes mean coin along other mean coins that WPRO was behind and so these coins started as pre-sales
and you look back at those similarities between the marketing of those coins and block
dag is there was a lot of artificial hype, kingdoms, last final chance, last mean coin ever
used in pre-sales a lot of heavy use of paid articles and all of the platforms will not all
but similar platforms are leverage on block dag those coins raised decent amount and at launch
I believe big lot of big eyes coin crashed by a hundred percent of much and WPRO was the agency
and we know that Gore hand is in charge of WPRO running the promo's behind that coin
those investors walked away with crashes and launch and WPRO if you look back at the public
articles that are out there WPRO was set up in a way where it provided it secured its own legal
protection so the project went down but WPRO remains tending and so you look at all of this marketing
and you look at the prior pre-sales and failures and you almost wonder is that the same set up
with WPRO currently are you able to share any context on that as far as it applies to block dag?
Sure so I have to actually honest I don't know much about that I mean I know the allegations
and community inferring links between the projects and the marketing teams behind it I would say that
those hallmark indicators that you talk about are quite common between a lot of projects
especially meme coins I mean that's how most meme coins are sold we obviously a lot of hard because
there isn't much value behind them so I think you could probably if you look for other projects
that seem to do some of the things you could probably find quite a few but again I haven't
looked to see so that closely they resemble the marketing between the two so I can't really
comment on that okay well on the same marketing deal you know we've got Nick as the CMO
I guess WPRO as being the Nick and said there were seven other marketing companies that were
involved but as far as I can tell and what I can see it seems like WPRO is operate in the whole
thing and so who approves these marketing strategies is it does it go through WPRO and then Nick
approves the marketing strategy and then it's distributed does it ever hit your desk
or you completely left out of the loop on these marketing strategies
So I think if I can ask you guys I mean I know you keep mentioning certain individuals
and WPRO as well I think I mean that's it is conjecture obviously is a lot of stuff out there
so I think let's just keep it to the marketing project or the marketing team for now
if you guys don't mind in terms of mind involvement with marketing I have
I'm not part of any processes in terms of approving or viewing or even vetting what's going up there
and they're kind of a happy I see some of it and when relevant I have tried to correct things
and obviously certain language I've tried to correct which might be some antimicror etc but
it certainly doesn't go through me and I've got very little control over that and it's never been my focus
so it's not that I said they're watching daily to see what the daily release is going to be
obviously going forward they will train change entirely and I'll have a team that is responsible
and I'll have oversight over them but right now unfortunately I just don't have that
that there's a ability or control over any of that
you know just to kind of close on that it's not just just me free style and coming up with
it there's we took a whole conglomeration of questions and noted them down and that was
definitely one of them and so I'm trying to go through this list as much as possible
so it's questions from the community it's not just me and my homie trying to pick on anything
it's literally what's out there you know and and these are the big questions
yeah I'd appreciate you guys are you are representing the communities so yeah we're
gonna happy that you're asking me these questions one of the questions that community has
been a lot of questions on the right now is to mine or delivery timelines and you know I'm
getting we're getting concerned because you know there's a there's a pattern of
you know from Baruja um I'm paid and voices allegations surrounding that so
what can you comment on the timeline whether that's still in place we're hoping that you know
because the community is that's one of their priorities right now getting those minor sex
turdies on time yeah are you able to uh comment on that yeah so I know that I mean of all
things though that the miners have been a hot topic for a long time and I understand that it was
the one so so tokens they were never gonna be delivered before TGE I mean that's obviously
the nature of a token but the miners have been promised and we've been through I took you through
the different different sort of iterations of who we were gonna who was gonna manufacture
in for us so we had different versions with different uh hashing algorithms etc so it was sort of
a rolling comedy of errors in terms of changes and re-engaging with new suppliers
and throughout all of that obviously the communities become one more frustrated because it
just looks like this thing's just rolling on and on and the dates that I gave and I don't
have been exactly but it was starting delivery in December and finishing I think by the end of
Jan if I'm correct that sounds about right now the X-Tens were supposed to start hitting
in master delivery about mid this month about right now but 30s and and 100s per year about about
a month after that yeah I said it just roughly it was December to January was the delivery time
I'm still pushing to to make that happen but it is pressure on that in terms of
slippage the problem with that is slipping at this time of the year isn't just two weeks you
suddenly slip and it bumps you right into next year so in short full transparency we we're still
okay but it's sort of touching go so I'm pushing as much as we can just to get those in and the
suppliers are already in waiting to get that moving as quickly as possible but the window is
closing pretty rapidly okay so if I hear you correctly then it it seems like the suppliers are
ready but they're waiting on us so I guess they're waiting on money so the X-Terdies that thought you
said the the order had been paid for the initial order had been paid for oh no I'm sorry
it was the X-100s that the initial order had been paid for is there more payments that are
pending that haven't been paid so it was actually the X-100 that the order had been placed so
that one's fine the others I mean I I'm other that loop in terms of finalizing the order so
the supply has the order I think they're just waiting for the finalisation of that on the
X-Terdies and the X-Tins as well okay well that leads right back into like if if if those
haven't been paid or if the suppliers are waiting on us you know how secure we've supposedly raised
430 million some of dollars how secure is the funds I mean why should we not just immediately
if if they're waiting on us that's a problem sorry is the question maybe you want to just
sorry yeah we've got to get these checks cut yeah I mean what do we have to do to get the
checks cut and over to the supplier so we can get stuff delivered you know yeah what is
going going in that just there's just been some delays I mean I'm hoping that we're as I said
I'm hoping we're all on track and and we get we get everything sorted and the delivery's
hot back on track but I mean we know that we're getting quite close into the year so
it's getting pretty tough well I just want to end up I'm sorry my home it you know I was in
construction in general contracting for quite some time and coming up on Thanksgiving if you don't
get stuff done prior to that then you know you got big problems like you said you got people that
are going to be off for about the next six weeks and that is that is a big problem so this is
more of an open statement to whoever is in control of that let's let's get the ball rolling because
absolutely no scenario where that is okay we raise the money on miners separately from the
sale of tokens that was all in its own category and that that money should be ready to it to be spent
money is action and we need action yeah sure I mean I think we're all aware of putting these
miners up and I think it's we all know that they're not necessarily of any use even once they're
arrived until we go until main net is launched but equally I think it's it's just a show that
it's so people need to see they need to see the miners arriving they want to get the miners
they're paid for so even though it's not material from a mining perspective it's important for everyone
to receive them and actually it's important for our test net as well we need the miners up there
before main net so we can launch a test net with ASIC miners as opposed to GP miners so yeah I
hear you fully I think people are stressed about their miners right now that's a daily question
they paid for it a while they've been waiting for a while there's no reason why they should be waiting
especially what holidays coming up so all I'll say to whoever is in charge is if those miners
do not come on time it will be a repeat of what happened this last week for the promo and that's not
me even being threatening at all but you know our communities have been waiting for a while
things need to happen we come on every year may we talk great you know but we need actions and
if that doesn't happen to WPRO you know it's gonna be all over again in terms of what went
down from this last promo yeah so it goes right back into you know the control of the funds
and are those funds secure I know that you said that you don't have have control over but we got to
make sure those funds are secure and that they're getting utilized for the things that that this
project needs like you said we can't watch the next test net without these miners in play and
this is this is a big problem we got what 90 days until precell supposed to close up like that so
we got to go yeah we need we need to get those miners up there we we need the miners
in play as an installed and mining ideally two months before before launch
because that's part of the test net and the testing of the miners and the miners and all those
protocols that's pretty crucial to be that we get them out there well I just got a number it says
8.127 million dollars and miner sales is about what is about what it calculates out to and
you know that that's all separate funding so we got to find eight million dollars somewhere
I saw a question in the telegram chat and this person has been tried to get an answer for
several AMA's now so I just wanted to give them a voice because they have been tagging me a lot
to get an answer but the question is how could we how could 435 million have been raised
they're only 16 billion tokens were sold and pretty much what they're stating is if you divide
that among the average price would come up to around 2.5 cents the starting points were
price were way lower than that and so the math has not mattered
I need to just have a look at that again I mean it's not a it's not something I've spent time on
I mean we saw with the bonus tokens the math didn't matter as well and that was obviously
because the numbers out there the public numbers weren't necessarily the right numbers I think that's
once the the bonus has been disclosed that that certainly helps but yeah I mean
but we can all do different bits of math I think the the key is once we do the transition
at that point we'll have the numbers we'll know the raise amount the cost amount
and the net amount after all of that so I mean there's a lot of guessing happening I mean
I get males all the time with different calculations but let's just wait till we get those numbers
that's that's all I can say for now well on that the $86 million investor
institutional style of investor I saw a lot of promos come out in the last say week to 10 days
that said that has been secured that it's in the bag but I don't I don't know that to be the case
it seems like that might have been misleading marketing or or whatever last I heard that there was
still some ambiguity on whether that was a sealed deal is that a sealed deal at this point
is it has the money been deposited is that money going to go into the transition like it
like is that all that money going to come over during the transition phase or is it going to stay
and you know how how's that all going to work and and is it actually working
and we may have lost Anthony again his telephone might be blowing up so I'll try to
rephrase that question a little better there's just so many ambiguities about it Muhammad
what do you have to say and I just want to say here to the community as well we're not just
coming here asking these questions these are questions that we've been getting hammered with overall
that are tied to the overall direction of the project in terms of you know the stuff that we're
asking so you know yeah I don't want to create the impression that these questions are coming
from us we are voices for a community so I just want to put that out there it's not our intention
to be negative but whereas concerned those are communities are hence so we have to address
okay and my back yeah you're back sorry we decided to fill the dead air there
no worries I'm just switched on my mobile just to make sure the connection stays up
just getting back to your questions so he has paid a size of all multimillion dollar deposit
so he's effectively is secured obviously until the rest of the rubber remaining money comes in
there's always a chance that something goes wrong but right now I mean it's it's it's a
damn deal that just needs finalization from payment perspective and we've already set up a multi-sig wallet
one of the one of the signatures actually one of the signatures myself the other signature Jeremy
CTO and then a third signature on the other side so that money will go into that multi-sig
so I think that's that's exactly where we wanted that's not part of the new structure but that's
an in-between it's just a temporary solution until we move to the new structure and then obviously
that will transition into that as well that will be that will be well secured speaking of Jeremy
he had a task for last week that was to find out some wattage on running miners that ever get done
the short answer is no Jeremy's actually I've just what's received and what's out from him
they've just arrived at Argentina they've just headed to DevConnect so I think that slipped his mind
because of DevConnect there was a bunch of prep that he needed to do for that but it's I
committed to it first time then he committed to actually this is third time so I will make sure
for next AMA that we do give that to you because that's that's on that's on me
I got a message from Lisa last night as she was boarding the plane heading out there and so I'm
I'm pretty excited about that I just on a on a lighter note I have been
building out an application for the build-of-thon and it is going real well I know
Mohammed has been working on one as well with Jeremy and we've seen a lot of progress I'm
interfacing with the blockchain as we speak and I'm running my smart contracts and everything's
going pretty well the RPCs have been working and so a lot of fun stuff happening there and
you know to be honest with you that's what I would rather be doing than then doing all this stuff
I would much rather be in the background doing mining pool node app development bringing these ideas
on chain and and that is where my focus really was in this whole situation and I hate it that we are
forced to be in this predicament. I'll just add to what Rick mentioned and you know
the earlier this weekend and it's still disappointing to me because I've never seen a project
try to silence its voices and I'll give you a specific example earlier this week when the
promo was posted I expressed my disapproval in the telegram chat and I was very respectful
didn't use any bad words or anything just all I said is I went back down from
speaking out against shady marketing I was instantly bad chat gone completely those moderators are horrible
I don't know who they are but they need to be fired they're horrible they just what they're doing
is so unethical silencing people who have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars it's just ridiculous
so tying this back to earlier conversations we definitely need that telegram chat changed
we're probably need new moderators to be honest and we need all of those bots gone they are
part of the problem they're not helping it the fact that we are so involved in this project trying
to build out ideas trying to advocate for our communities and we ourselves are getting bad imagine
what other people go through on a day-to-day basis his unacceptable is hypothetical and it's ridiculous
frankly speaking but along the lines of what Rick mentioned I would also tell our community you
know I know we're here and we're voicing certain concerns but please you know just keep engaging
with the technology itself I've been doing a Jamie have been doing it and it's so addictive
but last night I spent six hours trying to build out a builder time idea that I think is going to be
super cool Jamie has been taking up all day trying to build that out in we've been so excited just
seeing those ideas come alive detect visuals everything is I'm even getting goosebumps as I'm
talking up on it as a nerd but you know it's it's like we're like kids so we're not when
we see your ideas come alive so you know we're not just coming to the table just complaining
we're actually you know we're involved in minors no smart contracts build the tons you know we're
connecting with everyone to try and learn you know that's what I would encourage our community to
do as well because you know the marketing is going to go away but the tech itself is really what we
need to ensure that that's wrong foundation wise so sorry a little bit of ranting but if you're
listening to this you know in role in the builder time get your idea out there I know clue one tech
know who and how to do anything I've been putting myself through crash sessions and it's been
working out pretty well if I can do it you guys can do it yeah that's I mean that's great to hear
and as you say that's what we should be talking about that's where we should be spending our time
in energy and focus and yeah the more people that's the join that I mean it's a great program
that leaves put together and throw the two guys on it and and yeah there's good there's good
prizes there there's lots of opportunity to learn new things I remember if that this is your first
4A into the the tech side of web 3 then yeah it's it's an exciting place to be yeah so if anyone
wants to know more about that go to the website you'll find a link there through I think it's on the
probably on the hackathon page and that'll take you to the builder thumb it has started with
the multiple waves so you might miss the first wave I think the waves might be two weeks you
guys might be more familiar you just join in the second wave and you can you can slot in this
and the total duration is three months so yeah give it a go it's super exciting she's done a
wonderful job there and I've just got a message from Steve who's obviously listening in on this
he's on our team so he says the Jeremy did speak to him about measuring the wattage
and they've done some preliminary but they're going they're on to it so the guys are I'm
on it which is good I'm glad to hear that okay so my next time we'll give you some numbers
so the go ahead mom all right so the next block of questions came in it was about launch
listings roadmap we kind of covered some of it that launch can't happen we can't even get the
test net until the miners are in people's hands and distributed on a on a broad scale so I know
some of these are going to be predicated by by that but essentially we've got February 10th
I believe being the end of the pre-thales and we talked about a six week launch plan that
comes after that so you know people have speculated that you know in tomorrow somewhere in that
ballpark first the April would be like a launch in listing kind of time frame
can you can you give your thoughts on pre-sale launch listing and roadmap as of this point
yeah so I think prior to that we'll have another test net so and I think the good
the guys have called it as yes I'm a call correctly it will we'll first have a DevNet which
which will be for us to test the to finalise the testing on our ASIC miners obviously we've done
in office testing you saw the video from last time I hope that came through a cam on the video
but yeah so we'll be sending so we'll be testing with those around the wall as well so we'll
send a couple of those up to other spots and around the globe so therefore we'll do on a DevNet
then we'll progress that to a last test net which again we'll do we'll go through the same
motions of of starting from scratch as if it's a full main net but it'll be RZS test net
we'll let you know timing on that I'm not quite sure we'd have to check in with Jeremy
otherwise can confirm the S10th of Fib that's in the pre-sale if we haven't finished before
that that'll be the last time pre-sale and then it's roughly six weeks to get from there to TGE
and the listings and all of those steps and processes in there it might be short
it might be slightly longer so I think I'm not giving a definite date but I mean that takes us
roughly to the end of March so I think if anyone needs to work on a on a rough date that's roughly
where we are obviously that would change based on any sort of actual details close to time
well on that same token Dr. Hurley was mentioned in the last AMA that you know that he's still
advising the project and looking over things and you had mentioned that he was possibly going to
be to start doing some more sessions have you worked towards that or talked to him anymore about that
I think I said that we need to get away from these types of sessions and go back to other
more interesting sessions so that was the sort of context for it and for next week there's a
fair chance that I can't be on I'm not available Thursday so we'd either change it up
or even just schedule a session with Maurice I know the weekly cadence and the feedback is useful
so even if I just pre-record something just to give up a feedback but otherwise maybe we can have
so Jeremy's not back yet so from a tech perspective he'll still be over in South America but
are those we can get Maurice on there and maybe I'll think about who else on the tech side as well
could come in and give you guys some updates in terms of what's happening there so let me think about
that there are a couple of topics that Maurice and I have talked about that would be
interesting to present to the community if you guys have got anything in particular there was
I'll drop you a few ideas and see what you think everyone would be most interested in
okay I know a lot of people were asking about the governance model the DAO
but down and is that in production what does that look like there's a time frame on being
able to get some um some movement on that is that going to be something that is implemented
prior to the finalization of the tokenomics reconfiguration or is reconfiguration going to happen
prior to any form of voting on it that is a big question from the community
I've had some interesting conversations through email from the community some people saying
it's great that everyone votes on these things and in other saying
it's the project's problem that we created we need to fix it we need to make decisive decisions so
I'm not sure I think we would prefer to resolve those things earlier as in we don't want to
wait until sort of until the DAO is in place and we have a mechanism to vote before we finalize that
and so we might want to wrap at least those things up otherwise everything's been pushed out pushed out
so what do you I mean just the two of you what what you all quick view and I'll put you on the spot
like you do me so be quite often what what's your view on do we have the community voting on this or
do we just make a decision that we believe is in the best interests? I think that we've gotten a lot
of feedback from Nick community I think that there are definitely some call it different factions
or some people who say that number two to reference back to your slides number two was more
fair I believe to the early investors it really kind of retained some more of the 150% early
investor vote there's there's the other call it faction that that was leaning towards
the intent of the double up bonus I think Michael I can't remember his last name off the top
but he was talking about that last week is that you know there was an intent on buying for the
double up and so it kind of pushed towards that but we have had quite a bit of the community that
that I would say the majority of the community that agreed that number four was the best option
for fairness which was your geometric type of slope you know obviously we're not touching the
base coins so you know the base coins stay as is but it kind of does take a little bit away from the
early investors on the bonus and the double up on the bonus and kind of puts it towards the
middle who was the let's say due to promotions and stuff like that didn't quite get as good
to deal as as many of the others I personally think that does the fairs way I like the fact that
you know early people got a lot of base coins I just wanted to be as fair as possible and I
personally think that it needs to be done as quickly as possible so you know if it's going to take
weeks and months to get a DAO up and running I think that people want to see what their actual
position is prior to buying more prior to to making any other moves and I'll pass it to Mohammed
here to yeah so I'm just gonna add to that the one thing that I want to add is I agree which
read option four you know I know there were some outliers stating that we don't speak for them but
you know we've you know we've we've collected a lot of feedback we have had multiple conversations
on this and the consensus of the community comes down to option four and I just want to add to
that we're not looking forward and we're not looking out for ourselves because it would option
for it actually weren't against us and I say that because we could have stuck with one of the
option that benefits early investors and we would have hurt ourselves we could have stuck with
one of the option that benefits primary admitted investors and we would have also hurt ourselves
because you know we pretty much I'm not only a minor in the investor but I bought through
every batch as well you know the the model that you propose is consistent with every group
based on when they joined in and I think that's to to be fair and frank that's a more consistent
fair model I don't inquiscia wait for a doubt for voting people are pushing for those coins to
be reflected in their dashboard and we've had several a it may be talking about it polls feedback
submitted I think we should just get it over with so people could see what their coins are and
along the same token we have to have minor people are questioning when is that going to be out of
function because they're still able to get free coins from that or free spins you know so they need
to go on they need their coins converted so they could see all of that just you know a
a dollar was just going to prolong it we're getting towards the closer to pre and the presale
we just need to get it done right now okay I think that that's I mean that's useful feedback
and I tend to agree with you guys so I'm just waiting on final data from the the dashboard in
terms of all the purchases I can do accurate numbers because what I gave you was more sort of
that I had level I didn't reflect the actual buys in every month in every period so I just need to
to run those numbers I mean I need so I should be getting that in the next day also I'll run that
again and make sure it doesn't sort of market the change anything and then I'll put put together
sort of a a lost lost paper in terms of those different options and we can look at that and then
I think we just need to go with it as well and and the same with the tap mine I'm just looking
to find waiting for final numbers on that. All right good I think people would be happy the
their dashboard is updated one other question I have this is more on the tech side we've been
hearing a lot about Zeus coming are you able to share any insight in terms of you know how
that's going to be different from the current phase we're in from a tech standpoint because I know
came from awakening and on awakening we couldn't build out projects on that so that was a huge
one are you able to share any TZ or AP anything for the community in terms of what to look
forward to primordial primordial primordial yeah my bad just yeah I got that rock
for it we're at awakening my bad yeah yeah so I mean our focus now is the core defy
which we'll obviously was missing and we missed it by not too much time but I mean we've we've
completed an implementation of compound and also uni swap so I think there's a being wrapped up now
we may so so those would be deployed on on the next test net we have a launch plan as well
which again wasn't quite finished to the level we wanted for the last test net so that'll also be
that's going to be a longer term project we haven't spoken too much about it but it's
it's the basics of a launch pad so that'll be on it and then there'll be other components
as in probably things like um I'm hesitant to to mention the names because some of the
the protocols get uptight if you mentioned names when you have them contracted so we
discussions with come some of the and I'll mention a few names just to so there's no the likes
of the layers heroes and the axel eyes and the the the invios and those sorts of and and
different so different AMMs different bridges so we've we've chosen a suite of of brands
that are well known in the industry what we've realized is one thing to to roll your own to
compound or uni swap or whatever but for people to trust it now they've got a trust
that we've bought it correctly we've implemented it we've then got to have everything ordered
it that's also a process etc etc so we're actually going with with their parties for
all those components and so we'll have a full suite we've got the plan we spend quite a bit of time
sort of looking at them and deciding which were the better players and which work well together so also
as you're looking at which provider of stable coins I mean we not we won't offer back qualify
for native care for instance or circle just because we're in a new chain so we need to look
at alternatives we're also looking at alternatives well do we go with a wrapped version of
tiered or circle or do we go with something which which is less unknown for instance three carbon
or one of those M0 that give you some sort of yield so there's different options that we're
looking at there so we've mostly settled on those plans there we've as you're working with
the suppliers in terms of those being implemented so it's more of an implementation it's not a
build out and so those should all be in one or two of them don't really applicable so much
for test nets so that's those are the ones that maybe not it might not be there there's also potentially
one of the protocols that bring red U.S. stocks as well not core and not essential but it's
quite a nice one that people sitting anywhere can buy a wrapped version of Apple or Microsoft or
tier we need those stocks as well so yeah so the full suite of of D5 I think is the main thing
plus the launch pad the other thing is the finalizing and alvesting contract and having a dash
board behind that that gives you visibility of what coins you've got what's locked up what's unlocked
when you can unlock it allowing you to claim your coins etc so that'll be pretty important all
on chain again no one wants to trust us or anyone we won't people want to know that it's in
their control and it's sitting on chains so so I think it's it seems like there wasn't a lot
that happened in the last one there wasn't a lot that happened under the hook but on the sort of
surface it was it was sort of a little bit disappointing it was just another chain with not
a whole lot more the next one there'll be a lot more sort of apps on it there are a couple of games
that have gone through grants that'll be on there as well starvara motor decks those are the two
games there's two zero knowledge proof grant recipients that have been developing on us
one of them was gone off with us and they've got a demo in South America so we sponsored them to
be with it with our team and they're going to be running around with their tick which is always
handy when you're trying to have conversations and open conversations if you've got a nice sort of
cool demo so there's a lot of those things that you just that the community hasn't seen and we've
melted you'll be distracted with things so I think the next one will be there'll be a lot more
to see a lot more to play with as as a countryman who said it more than once as a community
aboard this I think is not like you can do on the net on the test net unless you're doing like
you guys building stuff but once you've once you've pulled the two token from the the four
sets and you've played the lottery ten times is not much else to do so I think the next one will
suddenly be a lot more exciting and it will feel like we're now getting close to launching some
special outstanding so this question right here is going to make my buddy in Greece's day
his name is Stava's Papas Stava's Papas and this is about compromised wallets so we have some
people who have equipment that is to be shipped and you know if we're paying for X100 I know he's
ordered quite a few X100s and has plans on a mining farm out there we have to I mean we can't
ship equipment to people who nefariously stole somebody's wallet so this needs to be kind of a
high priority item that gets taken care of prior to shipping of miners and you know although the
pre-sale allocation can be handled prior to TGE we need to definitely address the
compromised wallets that have hardware to be delivered yeah so I think what we're going to do
that now and we we busy putting our hits given terms of the exact process and also who to use if we go
with the the KYC route as well because I hope that's probably going to be part of the process
just to but the problem is if you go add hock in terms of send me various bits of paper and prove
that you're a holder and not and and and go back to various wallets that link into this from the
past and send another transaction it becomes quite difficult and the process will differ from
every person so I think we're probably going to try and run standardize on sort of a certain
thing you need to do you certain you need send us and you're going to have to do a fairly rigorous KYC
and if you pass those then the chances are you're the right owner because this camera's a
hardest likely going to want to go through that if two parties both go through it or then we'll
address it in a different way but I think that will weed up 99% of all this cameras but I think so
what we're going to do is we will make sure and we'll flag that we don't send any miners to anyone
that has a compromise wallet flag or has reported it so at least we don't go mess up by sending it to
the wrong person not to then just delay it so we've never fixed it but I think at least we just don't
make it worse by sending miners to the wrong person and then we don't need to get on to that as you
said the bulk of it's important for TGE but for the miners it's important to get that
done sooner or later and so that is on this. Okay so we've been talking about third parties a
little bit is there a third party that is going to take a look at the tokenomic situation prior to
a resolution finalization or is that going to be kept completely in-house is there another
company or maybe attorneys or something that's looking at that to ensure that we're doing the best
that we can do. So I've had one third party look at it and I realized that without quite a bit of
historic context the comments were sort of a little bit pointless and they brought up stuff that
we've talked about and we've sort of already either said that doesn't make sense or that's
maybe a solution so it wasn't necessarily particularly useful and I was hoping to get a bit more out of it
there's another party that I might bring it up with. The problem is it also slows things down so if
we try to resolve this and because there's no actual solution it's not that we're looking for
that the correct solution we try to balance a whole bunch of things in terms of what people believe
in their board versus what was should have been fair when they board and we try to come up with
something that across the board gives them a joy to people the best outcome and that's almost
and that's why I need the numbers, the data so I can run the numbers because then you start
looking statistically so how many people are better off or worse off what are the art layers
etc. So it's a bit of statistics and a bit of common sense and a bit of looking at the scenarios
which I think we've been quite a bit of time already so I don't really see it as a bit
of a lot of conversations and really add any value to the thing. That makes a lot of sense too
too because having watched the pre-sale for an extended period of time myself I believe that
somebody who's of sound mind and a smart person can kind of has a macro perspective over the whole
thing can really come up with a good solution I don't think I think you're right in in that
and at least I'm not a well I have I've got some besides team tokens I mean I've got
some tokens but I've bought those more just because I was on an off-test various things on the
back end so I'm affected the non-hold of stuff for me it's just I'm just looking for the fairest
solution for everyone so my views is unbiased which I think you guys are also demonstrated so
I think we're all just looking at the end of the day more happy investors that are feeling
positive about the project helps everyone so I think the problem is they ask for people out there
looking purely at themselves and saying you can't take away my bonuses this is illegal and
indefensible and all the risk and they're not necessarily wrong but we have to just find a solution
and it's really sort of says be pragmatic we're all going to lose something here but the bigger picture
is it's for the project and we need to protect the core tokens and that's the focus and we just need
to realise that collectively we need to do this and we need to need to be done in the best way possible
for the project as a collective. I agree I think you know it's I mean walking away with more could
mean you're getting zeros in front of what that actual price could be aligned so from people watching
this and you know focusing too much on bonuses I'm just tired of bonuses I just need us to move on
for the actual tech what we invested in so I agree with you one of the questions that I did want to
ask and it's a question that I believe my end stuff has also posed before and a few people in
the community is you know why is that presale still well it might it might have been
read my devises earlier but one of the main question is you know why is the presale still
going on why can it be paused at least until this transition is over because people are kind of on
certain in terms of you know their investments so you know is there any then you can add to that I
I know by now stuff has brought this up before and community so I just want to make sure.
Yeah sure so I mean in terms of the transition I will say that it would be a whole lot easier to pause
it as in stop what we're doing and really just focus on moving stuff over so I mean that's just
what's easiest for me to get the process done sort of expediently and other than that I mean I
can't comment on the pausing of the presale why it's a good old bad idea I mean from my perspective
pretty selfishly because I want to get the transition done I would I would I would like to pause it
but I mean there's obviously other factors that say play you and I can't comment on those and I mean
I think that there is a is a question around obviously for instance the large investor and
and the implications to those sort of conversations if you pause if we pause the presale
and also whether they're with it creates other negative connotations in the market if there's
a pause and then a restart so those are considerations but on the whole for expedience
a pause would be good but that's not where we are now
you had mentioned Binance stuff and he's on the YouTube stream right now he said
you know that one of the questions that's coming up quite a bit is
were you interviewed for this position as CEO or who interviewed you for your position here at
Blackbag and you know how did you wind up being just in charge of the development and not
in charge of full scope of you know finances and everything and marketing and everything else
so in terms of the first part of it I mean that's I think that's private so I've come coming to
on that but the intention and understanding from my side was that the place to start was the
tech side because that's where not that there were problems but it needed more focus
it was the place where we needed a lot more happening we didn't have any community
initiatives we didn't have any hack of funds or grants or anything like that so that was the sort of
or just a place to start and to focus and my understanding is that I would have
over time taken over and responsibility in the other areas it didn't happen and that's why we are here
at the moment so what since we first initially announced the transition what positive steps forward
have been made to facilitate that transition as anything started to be transition to
still all just learning enough holding pattern so I mean there's a fair bit of planning
that needs to go into it partly because of the structure that we're setting up and also
the best way to transition funds across to that I mean I'm putting myself and my lawyer we've made
making we've been very clear that we want that to be sort of a squeaky clean and compliant and
or regulatory compliant and financially compliant as possible so we're looking at how that
transaction and the transfers happen where the people elect to transfer across so we're looking
at those permutation so until we clear on exactly how that's going to happen that part of it
sort of is not there's not much on on the current project side that they have to do and that's
more on our side in terms of being clear how we want to want that to to transpire in terms of the
other things like taking over the marketing and especially things like support and the community
management and things like that and we starting to have those discussions now and there's been
a bit of planning around what there's are and how we can handle them as well. There was some
discussion around because we don't have necessarily the resources that potentially some of them
would stay with they were for a while but I think we've agreed and I'm sure we'll also agree
that it's better just get it all done and I'm going move it over, start fresh so it was a
little planning on our side in terms of who and how we're going to take those over as well so
there hasn't been any transition yet as in actual things that moved over I mean I said I said that
earlier so but there's a little there's quite a little planning that has happened I mean that's
important so it wasn't that it wasn't that day after it was announced that we could suddenly take
over the support so for instance support we could take over we could put new people
manning support desk but when they find a problem that they verify that's an issue with tokens that
weren't issued issued on the back end then we need to get it to the back end we need to
probably make changes there's authorities around that who has access to the database who can
change it who owns it all of those things so they're all they're all fairly complicated so it
just takes a little planning so nothing yet but we in the planning phase real quick but
are you able to share an update on when back to tokenomics last question and I'll move on from
that because I'm getting tired of that question can you give people watching tonight a timeline
of when they can expect their dashboards to get updated for a tap minor and the coin reduction
under dashboard um it's I can't and partly because it depends if we try to make an update
on the existing dashboard which is for it the old the outside or whether we replicating that in the
new side or redoing it's um either one takes time but by different teams etc I prefer that we
transition and when we move across we're on the new dashboard we focus on that as opposed to
sort of duct tag the old side of things or the old stuff so we're just looking at sort of how we do
that how much effort is to redo that first is taking across and making the changes um obviously it's
we also need to move the back end the database and all the rest so again it's a bit more complicated
than just making a few changes um so right now I can't give dates on that um practically it's going
to be it's not going to be sooner than three weeks I mean I'm just thinking of that there's a
favor that needs to be done I mean we need to first decide on a lot of the solution is and then
present it make the changes push that up all that out so three four weeks is probably and that's
why I say the end of the year is tight but that's we I think what will happen is most things will
come together because there's a lot of work streams so it's not that you'll see too many small things
I was hoping to start taking over for instance support but then I started realizing it's not so much
a support desk but it's the whole back end where there's issues that get stuck and it's now it's
now pains which is not pain provide so none of these are easy where you can just take over small
things and just say well he has it let's take the server for a quick win it's going to be sort of
a lot more it'll it's it'll all be sort of to the tail end of it where it's that when you're
comes to give it so then essentially now nodes and now payments I think he said it was
is that the same organization yeah yeah so now payments are on the dashboard if you buy the three
main points USTT Binance and what are the theory of those of those of three optic otherwise
if you go the other route which is obviously slightly different using to face that goes through
not at null payments okay I had gotten somebody who messaged me about those earlier in the week
they were having a problem with that support so I didn't quite understand because I haven't
purchased it in the theory of every time so it didn't I mean just just to mention
I mean it because I I've jumped into quite a few of the the support issues certainly when I see
people all people may only saying that they're not getting any resolutions I could have a look
and some of them are pretty complicated was I mean I'm going into them thinking well
actually this is quite a simple thing here's the transaction here attached this is where it came
from and then you realize there's and it's mostly when it comes to exchanges there's batching
of various things to suddenly you're missing so where you think you've seen to trauma ends up hitting
out servers or through non nodes it comes through on a different from a different wallet to the
one that you'd expect so there were quite a few complications and it's I mean we have a lot of
transactions so although they seem to be quite a few that go wrong it's really small in the
scheme of it and they are complicated and we keep sort of fixing the nuances where we can but some
of it you actually just need mainly to go and and step through and try and piece together what
we're wrong and why the things don't tie up so it is a bit complicated it's not sort of a
science it's not like in with what or two it just all works 100%. So when we implement these changes
that are upcoming is there going to be a revision of the white paper that brings in some
congruency I think the old white paper still actually register shows the registration to be
seashells and also you had mentioned something about moving to the current organization from Samoa
to various places and winding up in Switzerland or something to that effect so will that be
in the white paper as well if you are going to update it. Yeah so we've already updated the white
paper with most of the maker required clauses it did unfortunately it takes a white paper that
it's easy to read and it just makes it a bit of a mess because they throw in so many clauses
through the whole thing so we'll probably end up with two there'll be the maker compliant one which
has all the clauses and all the provisions and all the the the risk clauses and then we'll
have a normal non-meeker language is still the one that you can read easily and understand the
project but we'll certainly it needs to be updated with obviously the legal entities. The issuing
entity there's not there'll be some changes in terms of the removal of UTXO because that's still
in the white paper it talked about a dual token system so UTXO goes UTXO goes out we want to
diagram in there that need to be updated and no John still mentioned one the minor rewards
issuance had dates on it which showed that we started issuing mining rewards in March of this year
and that's obviously it was meant to be whenever we launched but there were dates on this so
then there will we'll go through it will update it but there's not too much to change as there except
the additional wall and mecha clauses. Did you write the initial white paper for this project
and I wasn't involved in that so I I was involved in I mean I didn't write up but I had my team
do the rewrite and that was Maurice and Manuel they they did all of that and that was from scratch
there was no boring or chat GPT or anything like that in that so it's and I think we still get
precise for white paper that's borrowed and got lots of AI in it which does always indicate that
someone hasn't necessarily read the new white paper because that is it's fresh at all written
that's it's pretty clean it's a decent document I mean I'm there's probably some good improvements
we can make to that as well is it when was that released do we have access to it which ones that
the the one that you wrote that used to be where to the doctor Maurice you know that's that's the
current one on the website okay and that was released like March of last year or so
no that was November ish and then I think we did an update in January okay okay so the main
main error or the main change in this is a review of UTXO and then obviously the jurisdiction that's
the corporate details are different in there as well we can present a November where they've been
about the third version then if I'm not mistaken there was an original and then it was changed
I think in March of 24 and then in November of 24 and then I guess January moving into the next one
would be like version five yeah and then you did three four and five yeah okay so I'm just so
I can mention that the next interim test net is incarnate so it's not serious I'm not sure
whether that's because that's more of an internal one for our internal testing of mine as
but that's just like correct myself on that okay
Mohammed you got something you ready to hurry up to the yeah yeah I was just gonna say moving
forward to can we just have more tech partnerships instead of stupid sports partnerships I mean
we need more real world-based partnerships not partnerships based on hype where money is
going out for just hype it's not benefiting our project cut off we need stuff that's gonna
actually lead to global adoption it's you know that that will be my only feedback on partnerships
moving forward people want to see real partnerships not the sports ones so ways to be in my opinion
yeah so so I think once the defy sweet is in then opens up those doors right now a chain with our
defy is a lot more difficult to find partners and also the partners we're using for the defy
the brands they are part of that whole partnership is them opening their doors up
perceptions so I think once we start embracing and working with them and those are and they they
they fairly costly but then you're paying because someone else has been through all the
auditing and and they're in their own brand and they they're reputable people trust them
I'm not sure if it's been mentioned in the past but we also are progressing with a
pre-launch TVL campaign as well given all of this that's been happening at Tasman
really being focused in terms of getting people know but we sort of put we put that together
because obviously it's important to bring to bring TVL out to the chain so that when we launch
we've got we've got liquidity in the pools etc so we'll be launching that it's an opportunity for
people to lock up at the tokens on the chain and earn fairly good yields and rewards as well
and we'll be layering layering in between b-dags and other rewards as well so that hopefully
hopefully we'll we'll create something that's quite enticing that pays out quite nicely and
obviously it's it's doubly beneficial for anyone who owns b-dags because it supports the
project as well so that'll be one of the things that will come out the other thing that we're
working on which we haven't got the details but Jeremy and I just finished the technical
implementation overview plan is is staking but on the mining side so
when I work give you more details for now but it's basically allowing you to stake
into mining pools and earn alongside the miners and we utilizing that
partly to improve the security on the chain because there's elements of slashing that comes in there
which you typically wouldn't have so we hoping that and as well we're we're going to be
leaning on Maurice as well in terms of how we can utilize that and the fact that there's
this funds that miners earn and his funds that other people earn that can be slashed
if the miners must behave which is typically not something you have in approval work
unless you lock up the mining the mining walls and so so that's it it's an interesting
lever that we can use to sort of keep miners playing nicely and it's also quite a
useful lever in terms of obviously getting people to lock tokens up as well so we're using it
for that so we we've designed that the technical side there's some technical implementations
that we need to cater for so that'll be bought up but we'll come up with more details in terms of
what that means to the community sort of probably in the next two, three weeks once we sort of
finalize that you want to open up the chat and I can do I'm looking at the time we
have we're in our 20 minutes in so the chat comes though if anyone wants to send in your messages
yeah if we can keep it to every 10 minutes it'll be great
they come in fast yeah someone's asking about wallet and I mean that's a whole bigger
conversation I know we touched on at last time it's maybe something we can bring up in the next
day may to discuss and I'll make sure that I've got maybe a bit more background to that
so I can answer that better um if you guys want to pick from here I'm also looking as we go through
voltage on the miners they support anything from 110 up to 250 and 50 60 hertz so
they'll work anyway um I think they'll be shipped with three plugs so that's the only thing
is if you're in an exotic location you might need a some sort of converter but I think it'll come
and I can check on this probably come with US European and UK plugs if I remember incorrectly
obviously we can't ship with a plug for every part of the world so we pick the three most sort of
common
see a question on why don't you showcase an AMA so best apps meet throughout hackathon I know
that's something Lisa's working on so I'm pretty sure she'll have more to share on that
because build a ton is still ongoing so probably still need to wait on that to finish but
Lisa that is Lisa's list yeah um question on algorithm for the x 100 and x 30 so that's script
so to script algorithm it's been customized so no one else can mine on our chain and our
miners unfortunately also can't mine on any other as script change as well and that was done on purpose
and the x 30 and the x 100 are Wi-Fi enabled if you look if you look at the video from last time
or some of the pictures that are around there's a little Wi-Fi um aerial on it and so yeah Wi-Fi enabled
okay um so we have been talking about the tokenomics issue and trying to finalize it
we can't really finalize it until we figure out what the status is of the $86 million investor
correct because that's gonna play havoc on any math so if there a timeline a deadline for that
to take place um because we need uh we need a final solution if you will not uh an interim if
when and but yeah can you address that yeah and good point out I think I mean earlier on I was
thinking about that as well but I didn't throw it into the mix but you're right so that changes
everything drastically um I think and yes it brings a lot more tokens into the whole mix it's
will impact everyone and I have mentioned that if that happens we may need to look at the mine in
pool um just to big borrow steal from that pool but um I think it's all the worthwhile invested
to bring in it brings in obviously a lot of money and it it'll come straight to let's call it
the future coffers so there's no there'll be no expenses attached so it's it's it's worthwhile so
I think if I can just leave it at that so let's and yeah I think for everyone out there it's
even if you lose more bonuses because of that I think the upside and will be definitely worth
part to you and that's just my cut feel at the stage obviously once once we've got all the numbers
then you can really look at it and you'll sort of understand that my guests and the right now is
it's it's worthwhile making space for that investor and I believe the next crunches do
beginning of December so I mean it'll be quite soon once we've got clarity on that
and we've we'd pushing for that as well because that is key we can't actually finalize anything
at all until that's just until that's final it's the liquidity at lunch still a hundred million
because I know that was one of the core you know information put out there so just curious
so there's no need for a hundred million I mean it was a number that was thrown out there
I mean it always surprised me because it didn't necessarily make sense but I didn't necessarily
know enough about what the mind what the listing process would require but it just didn't
seem it didn't make sense but so the exchanges and the market makers obviously need need
liquidity and it'll be a combination of B-Dag and and a stable coin USDT or C and
some of them will lend it to you but then it comes back and fees is a different
limitations but we probably I'll budget it on roughly probably fire again it depends on whether
we're in with a finance or a coin base or not because obviously those guys have fire fire
requirements but five million coins and five million dollars is probably what we need
depending on maybe more if we could bring up with a finance or coin base or something like that
and that's what we need this if you give them a hundred million they'll say well they don't
want to design they can do with that sort of thing so it's more liquidity is no better that's
they business and we'll give them what they believe is the right number from what I saw you know it's
about 10% of what you got circulating and where my my estimates are that we're going to be
at about 10 or eight to 10 billion circulating at the 40% initial vesting so yeah it's a hundred
million would be way in excess I'm getting a lot of good questions one of them from John
Snell this has been asking ask quite a bit is you said that you have some attorneys that are
representing the transfer can you tell us anything about what firm that is or or anything in relation
to the people that are advising this transfer I can't share that and I wasn't expecting to
to share that I think I mean it's probably fine maybe next session but I think I need to just
clear that with them first I mean then it did focus is primarily on this structure and how we do
the transition of the money I mean that's obviously the crucial part and setting up the structure
that will be functional and helping with the dowels as well so that's the main focus so I'll see
if I can share that next time whether it's appropriate I don't think it's necessarily too material
there is more firm that they've been active in the space for I think eight years so I mean it's
they're Europe based so they know me because they know the European side of things so they
from I'd expect to do a great
and there's a question on any updates on US exchanges I mean primarily that would be Coinbase or Kraken
type discussions because of the transition we've sort of slowed down the discussion on
this things just because it doesn't make sense to progress those and then find we're changing
with its tokenomics or entities which is fine we've got for now we've got relationships we've
opened the door so we're in conversation between our kind of progress that further and we've
promised that we've got conversations with pretty much everyone some of them will still
probably be too challenging and the US obviously adds additional complexities as well in terms
of how it tests and things like that so I'm not sure about the US that's the mark we least
certain whether we'll have a listing there or for bet maybe with a new structure and everything
being squeaky clean it makes a lot easier I'm not sure then. What can the community do to help foster
this transition and and expedite it because that is the sentiment that I'm getting here is they want
it done now and there's there's there's there's very very little patience left for things
continuing on as they are and if you know if there's anything that I want to close on it's
what do we have to do to get this done and get it done ASAP I mean there are so many people
that would love to help people that would bend over backwards to try and get this thing going
and any ideas. Yeah so I think I think pressure from the community doesn't help
the situation I'm in the process is going to take time I mean I'm a little bit disappointed I
thought we could sort of move quite quickly but as I thought she has always get into it and
they start looking at the detail then they say over this and that and this I'm going to take
with longer and we need to be careful with this and those sort of things so it's typical sort of
lowest low things down but I think at the end of the day it's for the right reasons so I'm happy that
we're doing it properly I think everyone would agree that that's what we want to do at the end of
the day it doesn't help it's not going to happen quicker if we push harder some of the stuff
just needs time so I think it's we need a bit of patience I mean as soon as things start
moving I'll try and feedback as and when I can and if we can keep up the science maybe next
Thursday but otherwise I'm happy with we keep these going every week right until pretty much
Christmas and hopefully by then hopefully by then we can stop talking about this and we'll be
for a refocus back on Maurice and the tech guys and and all the other good stuff and
these will be telling you about whether you guys have won or not won the the ball the final
all those great things but yeah I think it's we we just we sort of have to be patient these things
can't this quite a bit on our side that we have to do so it's not it's not just on the other side
that they're going slow and we need to put things in place as well it's it doesn't help we do
transfer and we just I get the whole thing up because we're not ready and we don't have support people
and we don't we don't have things in place it's actually so I think it's just a bit of yeah we just
need a bit of patience I'm going to just mention that we can do Maurice and our whole
other session we could do two a week and it wouldn't be a problem just just want to throw that out
there that there could be a whole other aspect happening parallel to this and I can always say
that we want to true CEO I know you've been doing a lot of work to on the development piece we
wouldn't have gotten here in terms of the tech deliverals that we're seeing right now if it wasn't
for the work that you and your team are performing and that's the reason why people are anxious because
they want us to run like a true crypto project and they want an honest decent CEO to actually
be there and community wise we all believe in you we want you to be in charge of this project because
you know that's that's the only hope we have right now in terms of getting us back on the right
path and people are worried nervous scared and you know I believe I speak for everyone when
I say like we want you to be in charge of everything including marketing all the garbage that's
happening right now appreciate that that very much I mean it's yeah appreciate that sentiment and
thanks to the community for for that third of confidence I'm doing what I can and I'll continue to do
just on that note there's probably going to be a requirement for the community and I'm not
sure how it actually gets done but the community to to nominate or let me to represent the community
and probably the two of you or whoever that might be and just in terms of again some of these processes
we try to look at how we fast track some of the things for instance if there's transfers of
money but there's no entity that's been formed yet but we want to start these processes they
might need to be sort of a holding account or someone holding holding funds on behalf of
project and how we do that and obviously I don't want to do that in my first full name so we need
to do it in the effectively for the community so there's probably some level of authority there
from the community to represent and potentially you guys as well I mean just that's just a
just for the community to understand that if obviously that comes through then that's that's the
reasoning behind it as we just try to sort of find pragmatic ways of doing it that doesn't
come into we're not moving it into a space where we compromise things by transferring it to me
or something like that needs to go straight into these entities which probably won't exist for a month
so yeah so I mean I'll let you guys learn you can obviously arrange that but that's just for
a community to understand that and that becomes more relevant obviously once we go to the
dial and the dial then votes for a management team etc then it becomes more sort of formal but right now
this might just be an interim step to get some things in place that's a type of leadership we need
so okay okay I mean there's there lots more questions here I think it's probably
not a bad thing to call it a day yeah if we if we have an answer to your questions
we'll be doing this every week I might not be on next Thursday so we can either change the date
or I'll switch in someone more for a more interesting and exciting conversation that we can
come back to this in the following week well I appreciate your time I know that we're not
ever going to make everybody happy I've had a lot of personal conversations with you I believe
you to be honest man and that you're really looking to do the best thing for the project I
know that some people will sling mud and throw shots but I believe that to be the case and I think
that once full power is transitioned over that there will be a definite visible and noticeable
difference in operations and and that things will start running smoother and we'll start paying
our bills on time and getting minus shipments done and start operating with some fiscal
responsibility with some transparency. On that note thanks very much everyone appreciate you having
you here and thanks Reed thanks Mohammed as usual great to have you on yet asking some nice
tricky programming questions I was told that I started doing this whenever I'm being asked
to tough questions I've been I was mentally thinking not to move when I'm you know feeling
pressured and but now you know my tell so if you have a play poker give me
my tear yeah we will not tell me like that anyway but yeah happy to be appreciate all the
questions and yeah I think together we'll get through this I mean we've got a good project
we've come off a we've got a large investor base we've got good investment we've got a good
road map and a good plan and good tips so next you're looking forward to launching this thing
it's about time thank you but thanks again everyone all right let's see you here
