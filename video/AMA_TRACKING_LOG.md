# BlockDAG AMA Tracking Log

**Purpose:** Track all BlockDAG AMAs over time to identify patterns, delays, and changes.

## Patterns Observed

### After 2 AMAs (Oct 31 + AMA #13):
- **Technical claims made without evidence** ⚠️⚠️
- **CEO admits lack of control** ⚠️⚠️ (Oct 31: unclear, AMA #13: "not in charge yet")
- **Financial crisis deepening** ⚠️⚠️ (Oct 31: oversale admitted, AMA #13: no CFO, suppliers unpaid)
- **"By end of year" used for ALL promises** ⚠️ (vague timeline pattern)
- **Community forcing changes** ✅ (128M promo canceled after backlash)
- **Builder-thon shows blockchain functional** ✅ (Community verification)

### Positive Patterns:
- Project responded to community backlash (128M promo canceled)
- Builder-thon progressing - community can actually build on chain
- CEO appears honest about limitations (admits not in control)
- Community representatives (Reed, Mohammed) given platform

### Concerning Patterns:
- **Testnet delays:** Still no date, blocked by miner distribution
- **Technical claims without evidence:** Pattern continues (0% evidence in AMA #13)
- **Financial crisis:** No CFO, suppliers unpaid, math doesn't add up
- **Leadership vacuum:** CEO not in control after 13 AMAs
- **Transparency issues:** Critical questions still deflected
- **"By end of year":** Used for everything (CFO, transition, etc.)
- **UTXO removed from whitepaper:** Major architecture change not explained

## Metrics Over Time

| 2025-10-31 | 0/10 | Zero code, testnet, or technical demonstration |
| 2025-11-XX (AMA #13) | 2/10 | Builder-thon shows basic functionality, but still no GitHub, no testnet, 0% evidence for CEO claims |

### Financial Transparency Score
| Date | Score | Reasoning |
|------|-------|-----------|
| 2025-10-31 | 2/10 | Admitted problems but deflected accountability |
| 2025-11-XX (AMA #13) | 1/10 | No CFO, math doesn't add up, suppliers unpaid, WPro controls funds |

### Organizational Stability Score
| Date | Score | Reasoning |
|------|-------|-----------|

| 2025-11-XX (AMA #13) | 1/10 | CEO admits "not in charge yet", WPro controls project, transition stalled |

### Overall Credibility Score
| Date | Score | Reasoning |
|------|-------|-----------|
| 2025-10-31 | 2/10 | Multiple red flags, no technical evidence, accountability unclear |
| 2025-11-XX (AMA #13) | 1.5/10 | Situation worsening: CEO powerless, financial crisis, no CFO, suppliers unpaid |

## Predictions for Next AMA

### How Previous Predictions Fared (Oct 31 → AMA #13):
- [x] Restructuring mentioned again - ✅ Correct: Entire AMA about transition
- [x] Technical claims without evidence - ✅ Correct: 0% evidence provided
- [x] Still no code shown - ✅ Correct: No GitHub
- [x] Testnet delayed further - ✅ Correct: Blocked by miner distribution
- [x] New financial issue emerges - ✅ Correct: No CFO, suppliers unpaid, math doesn't add up
- [x] More leadership changes - ✅ Correct: CEO admits "not in charge"

**Prediction Accuracy: 6/6 (100%)**

### New Predictions Based on AMA #13:

**Expect for Next AMA:**
- Miner delivery will miss December window (holiday manufacturing shutdown)
- Transition still "in progress" with new excuse
- $86M investor deal will be used to justify more delays
- Tokenomics still not finalized ("waiting on investor")
- More "by end of year" promises
- Still no GitHub repository
- If miners don't ship: major community crisis
- Technical claims will be DeFi-related without demos

**Track these predictions:**
- [ ] Miner delivery delayed into 2026
- [ ] Transition incomplete, new timeline given
- [ ] $86M investor cited as blocker
- [ ] Tokenomics finalization delayed again
- [ ] No GitHub still
- [ ] DeFi claims without evidence
- [ ] Community backlash if miners don't ship
- [ ] "End of Q1 2026" becomes new vague timeline
