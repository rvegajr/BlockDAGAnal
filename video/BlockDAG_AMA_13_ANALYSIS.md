---

## Overall Assessment

### Technical Progress Score: 2/10
**Reasoning:**
- Some builder-thon activity shows blockchain is functional at basic level
- No GitHub, no code shown, no working demos in this AMA
- All claims are "in progress" or "coming soon"
- Can't launch proper testnet without miners distributed
- DeFi suite claimed but not demonstrated

### Financial Transparency Score: 1/10
**Reasoning:**
- No CFO for $430M+ fundraise
- CEO doesn't know where money went ("gap... I'm not sure")
- Math doesn't add up per community calculations
- Suppliers unpaid despite massive funds raised
- Pre-sale oversold by 100%
- "Public numbers weren't necessarily the right numbers"

### Organizational Stability Score: 1/10
**Reasoning:**
- CEO explicitly states "I'm not in charge yet"
- WPro controls finances and marketing independently
- Transition announced 2 weeks ago with no progress
- Can't pause pre-sale even though CEO wants to
- Moderators banning investors who question things
- Community representatives threatened with bans

### Overall Credibility Score: 1.5/10
**Reasoning:**
- CEO appears genuine but admits he's powerless
- Massive financial red flags throughout
- No technical evidence despite 13 AMAs
- Connection to failed WPro projects (Big Eyes Coin)
- Community uprising required to cancel bad promo
- Numbers don't add up and CEO can't explain
- "By end of year" for everything - no accountability

---

## Predictions for Next AMA

Based on patterns, expect:
1. Transition still "in progress" - more delays announced
2. Miner delivery pushed into 2026 (misses holiday manufacturing window)
3. New excuse for why tokenomics can't be finalized ($86M investor as scapegoat)
4. More "by end of year" promises that slide
5. If miners don't ship by December: major community backlash
6. Technical updates will be more "coming soon" claims without demos
7. Community pressure will force more changes (as with 128M token promo)
