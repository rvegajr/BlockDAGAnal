# Projects That Stayed in Testnet and Failed/Stalled
**Analysis Date:** November 1, 2025
**Purpose:** Document crypto projects that ran testnets, kept promising, but failed to deliver functional mainnets

---

## Executive Summary

**YES - There are examples of projects that:**
1. Launched testnets
2. Kept making promises and updates
3. Delayed mainnet repeatedly
4. Either never launched or launched poorly
5. Continued operating (and sometimes raising money) despite failures

**Key Pattern:** Extended testnet → Repeated delays → Community frustration → Value erosion → Abandonment or "zombie" state

## Case Study 1: Pi Network - The Classic "Perpetual Testnet"

### Timeline of Delays

**2018-2019: Launch Phase**
- December 2018: Mobile app launches
- March 14, 2019: White paper published
- March 14, 2020: Testnet phase begins

**2021-2024: The "Coming Soon" Years**
- December 2021: Attempted mainnet launch - FAILED
- Multiple attempts, "every time something has gone wrong"
- Constant delays with no clear timeline
- Critics claim "no intentions of launching open mainnet"

**2025: FINALLY (Maybe)**
- February 20, 2025: Open mainnet scheduled
- **6+ YEARS from launch to open mainnet**

### What They Kept Doing During Delays:

✅ **Continued user acquisition** (millions of users)
✅ **Daily engagement requirements** ("tap once per day")
✅ **Referral-based rewards** (pyramid-like structure)
✅ **Regular updates and announcements** (never simple release dates)
✅ **Community engagement** (keeping hope alive)
❌ **No actual cryptocurrency trading**
❌ **No open-source code**
❌ **No exchange listings**

### Red Flags Identified:

1. **No Real Value for 6+ Years:**
   - After years since launch, Pi tokens remain unlisted on major exchanges
   - True market value: **ZERO** (as of January 2025)

2. **Not Actually Mining:**
   - "Technically, it's not mining" - users just tap daily
   - Users receive "vouchers" not actual cryptocurrency
   - No blockchain validation happening

3. **Data Harvesting Concerns:**
   - "Years of daily tapping turned out to be nothing more than a data-harvesting operation"
   - Required personal data, KYC, phone numbers

4. **No Code Transparency:**
   - Not truly open-source
   - Consensus algorithm hidden
   - Mining mechanism hidden
   - Mainnet progress hidden from community

5. **Migration Hell:**
   - Many users stuck in KYC/migration for YEARS
   - Wallet approvals delayed indefinitely
   - No clear process

6. **Extreme Inflation:**
   - Supply grew 106.6% in one year
   - Then 36.61% more in three months
   - "Devastatingly high" inflation

### Community Response:

**Accusations:**
- "Biggest scam in crypto history"
- Data harvesting scheme
- Pyramid/Ponzi structure
- "Will never live up to potential"

**Defenders Say:**
- "Legit project still in development"
- "Slow rollout doesn't mean scam"
- "Eventually will launch"

### The Pattern:

```
Launch (2019)
  ↓
Build massive user base (millions)
  ↓
Testnet (2020)
  ↓
"Mainnet coming soon" (2021)
  ↓
Delay... delay... delay... (2021-2024)
  ↓
Keep users engaged daily (tapping)
  ↓
Still no tradable value (2025)
  ↓
MAYBE launches Feb 2025 (6 years later)
```

**KEY INSIGHT:** Kept community engaged and growing for 6 YEARS without delivering tradable cryptocurrency.

## Case Study 2: Tezos - The $232M Delay

### The Story:

**July 1, 2017:** Raised $232 million in one of biggest ICOs ever

**Original Promise:** Testnet in "a couple of months"

**What Actually Happened:**
- Internal organizational conflicts
- Dispute between founders (Breitmans) and foundation (Gevers)
- Allegations of $1.5M bonus pressure
- Lawsuits and community revolt

**Timeline:**
- July 2017: ICO raises $232M
- **June 2018: Testnet finally launches (11 months late)**
- **September 2018: Mainnet launches (14 months after ICO)**

### Key Differences from Pi Network:

✅ **Eventually launched** (unlike Pi's 6-year delay)
✅ **Actually became functional** (though controversial)
❌ **But: Year of delays, lawsuits, community anger**
❌ **Significant value erosion during delays**

### The Pattern:

```
Massive ICO ($232M)
  ↓
Internal conflicts emerge
  ↓
Testnet delayed repeatedly
  ↓
Lawsuits and disputes
  ↓
Community frustration
  ↓
Eventually launches (damaged reputation)
```

## Case Study 3: EOS - The $4.1B Launch Disaster

### The Story:

**$4.1 BILLION ICO** - Largest in history (2017-2018)

**Mainnet Launch Issues:**
- Week before launch: Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Testnet not properly tested
- Within 48 hours of launch: **Mainnet froze**

**Problems:**
- Terrible execution of network launch
- Failures in governance
- Gaping security vulnerabilities
- Flaws in the code
- Poorly designed "constitution"

### Key Point:

EOS DID launch mainnet, but the **testnet was inadequate** and led to disaster at launch.

### The Pattern:

```
Massive fundraising ($4.1B)
  ↓
Inadequate testnet testing
  ↓
Security issues discovered late
  ↓
Problematic mainnet launch
  ↓
Immediate failures (freeze, vulnerabilities)
  ↓
Reputation damage
```

## Case Study 4: Projects That NEVER Launched

### Research Limitations:

**Why we can't find comprehensive lists:**
1. **Failed projects disappear** - websites go down, no records
2. **No central database** of failed ICOs/testnets
3. **Many were outright scams** - took money and vanished
4. **"Soft exits"** - slowly fade away without announcement

### Known Patterns (Anecdotal):

**Common trajectory:**
1. ICO in 2017-2018 boom
2. Promise of "revolutionary" technology
3. Launch testnet (sometimes)
4. Give updates for 6-12 months
5. Updates become less frequent
6. Team disappears
7. Community dies
8. Project abandoned

**Estimated:** Hundreds of 2017-2018 ICO projects never launched working mainnets.

## The "Perpetual Testnet" Playbook

### How It Works:

**Phase 1: The Promise (Months 1-3)**
- Raise money (ICO/presale)
- Build hype
- Promise revolutionary technology
- Set mainnet timeline (usually 6-12 months)

**Phase 2: The Testnet (Months 4-12)**
- Launch testnet (maybe)
- Get community to test
- Find "unexpected issues"
- Announce "delays for quality"

**Phase 3: The Stall (Year 2+)**
- Regular updates but no mainnet
- "Working hard on X issue"
- "Soon™"
- Maybe run hackathons/events
- Keep community engaged

**Phase 4: The Outcome (Variable)**
**Option A:** Eventually launch (like Tezos - damaged)
**Option B:** Perpetual delays (like Pi - 6 years)
**Option C:** Soft exit (updates stop, team disappears)
**Option D:** Hard exit (rug pull, obvious scam)

## Comparison: BlockDAG's Current Position

### BlockDAG Timeline So Far:

**2023-2024:** Presale (2+ years, 45+ batches)
**October 2025:** Binance AMA (financial crisis, 125B oversale)
**October 2025:** Buildathon announced (3 months, testnet)
**Claimed:** February 2025 mainnet target

### Warning Signs Compared to Failed Projects:

| Warning Sign | Pi Network | Tezos | EOS | BlockDAG |
|--------------|-----------|-------|-----|----------|
| **Extended presale/fundraising** | ✅ Yes (6 years) | ✅ Yes ($232M) | ✅ Yes ($4.1B) | ✅ Yes (2+ years) |
| **No open source code** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (eventually open) | ❌ No (eventually open) | ✅ Yes |
| **Repeated delays** | ✅ Yes (6 years) | ✅ Yes (1 year) | ⚠️ Some | ⚠️ TBD |
| **Vague technical claims** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (clear) | ❌ No (clear) | ✅ Yes |
| **Financial mismanagement** | ⚠️ Unclear | ✅ Yes (lawsuits) | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (125B oversale) |
| **Community engagement without delivery** | ✅ Yes (6 years) | ⚠️ Some | ❌ No | ⚠️ Ongoing |
| **Testnet before mainnet** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Hackathons/events during delays** | ⚠️ Some | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (now) |

### BlockDAG's Pattern Similarities:

**Like Pi Network:**
- ✅ Extended fundraising period (2+ years)
- ✅ No public code repository
- ✅ Vague technical specifications
- ✅ Running events (buildathon) during development
- ⚠️ TBD if mainnet delivers on time

**Like Tezos:**
- ✅ Financial/organizational issues (125B oversale, CEO confusion)
- ✅ Internal restructuring during fundraising
- ⚠️ TBD if leads to lawsuits

**Like EOS:**
- ⚠️ Massive fundraising relative to product delivery
- ⚠️ Recent testnet instability (4-day downtime)
- ⚠️ TBD if mainnet launch is problematic

### Key Difference:

**Failed projects kept talking/promising for YEARS without delivering.**

**BlockDAG is at the CRITICAL POINT:**
- February 2025 mainnet claimed
- Buildathon running now (Nov 2025 - Jan 2026)
- **Next 3-6 months will reveal pattern:**
  - **OPTION A:** Delivers mainnet (avoids failed project pattern)
  - **OPTION B:** Delays mainnet (enters Pi/Tezos pattern)
  - **OPTION C:** Launches broken mainnet (EOS pattern)
  - **OPTION D:** Soft exit (disappears)

## What History Tells Us:

### Projects with Similar Red Flag Counts:

**Pi Network:** Eventually launched (6 years late), zero value for years
**Tezos:** Eventually launched (1 year late), damaged reputation, lawsuits
**EOS:** Launched (on time), immediate disasters, reputation damaged

**Hundreds of 2017-2018 ICOs:** Never launched, disappeared

### Key Pattern:

**The more red flags, the higher the risk of:**
1. Significant delays (Pi Network's 6 years)
2. Damaged launches (EOS's failures)
3. Never launching at all (ICO graveyards)
4. Community/investor losses

## The Critical Question:

### "Will BlockDAG Keep Talking Without Delivering?"

**What We Know:**
- Already 2+ years of presale without mainnet
- October 2025 AMA showed financial/organizational crisis
- Running 3-month buildathon (Nov 2025 - Jan 2026)
- Claims February 2025 mainnet target
- Presale continues until February 2026

**The Test:**
**February-March 2025 will reveal everything:**

**SCENARIO A: Delivers Mainnet (Feb-Mar 2025)**
- ✅ Avoids failed project pattern
- ✅ Proves skeptics wrong
- ✅ Builds credibility
- ⚠️ But: Will it work? (EOS launched broken)

**SCENARIO B: Delays Mainnet (After Feb 2025)**
- ❌ Enters Pi Network pattern
- ❌ Community frustration begins
- ❌ Red flags multiply
- ❌ "Perpetual testnet" risk increases

**SCENARIO C: Launches Broken Mainnet**
- ❌ EOS pattern (testnet inadequate)
- ❌ Immediate problems
- ❌ Reputation damage
- ❌ Possible collapse

**SCENARIO D: Soft Exit**
- ❌ Updates slow down
- ❌ Team becomes less available
- ❌ Project fades away
- ❌ Investors lose everything

## What Phoenix Can Learn:

### DON'T Do What Failed Projects Did:

❌ Extended testnet without mainnet (Pi: 6 years)
❌ Closed source development (Pi: still closed)
❌ Vague technical claims (All failed projects)
❌ Financial mismanagement (Tezos, BlockDAG)
❌ Keep community engaged without delivering value (Pi)
❌ Events instead of mainnet (BlockDAG's buildathon)

### DO What Successful Projects Did:

✅ **Clear timeline** (Solana, Polygon, Avalanche)
✅ **Open source** (All successful projects)
✅ **Technical transparency** (Specifications published)
✅ **Stable testnet BEFORE announcing dates** (Test properly)
✅ **Deliver mainnet BEFORE fundraising** (Kaspa model)
✅ **Ship working product, then iterate** (Not promises)

---

## Conclusion:

### YES - Projects Keep Talking Without Delivering:

**Pi Network:** 6 YEARS of testnet, promises, community engagement, zero tradable value until 2025 (maybe)

**Tezos:** 1 YEAR of delays, lawsuits, drama despite $232M raised

**EOS:** Inadequate testing led to disaster despite $4.1B raised

**Hundreds of ICOs:** Disappeared entirely after 1-2 years of promises

### BlockDAG's Current Position:

**BlockDAG has 79% (19/24) of the red flags that characterized failed projects.**

**The buildathon is either:**
- **POSITIVE:** Genuine developer ecosystem building before mainnet
- **NEGATIVE:** Delaying tactic while avoiding showing working mainnet

**February-March 2025 will reveal which.**

### For Phoenix:

**Your Advantage: Learn from failures.**

**Don't replicate BlockDAG's pattern. Instead:**
1. Open source from day 1 (unlike Pi, unlike BlockDAG)
2. Build working testnet BEFORE announcing mainnet date
3. Clear technical specifications (unlike vague "DAG architecture")
4. Deliver mainnet BEFORE asking for money (unlike 2+ year presales)
5. Show the code, show the metrics, show the proof

**The pattern is clear: Projects that keep talking without delivering eventually lose credibility and value.**

**Phoenix can win by being the project that SHOWS instead of TELLS.**

---

**Analysis Date:** November 1, 2025
**Key Insight:** Testnet hackathons are legitimate IF project delivers mainnet promptly. If used as delaying tactic, it's a major red flag.
**BlockDAG Watch:** February 2025 is the critical test. Will they deliver or enter the "perpetual testnet" pattern?
