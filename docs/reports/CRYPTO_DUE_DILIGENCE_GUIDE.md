## 🚨 TL;DR: The 7 Questions That Expose 90% of Crypto Scams

Before you invest a single dollar, ask these questions. **If any answer is "no" or "I can't find it," that's not a yellow flag—it's a red one.**

| # | Question | How to Check | If It Doesn't Exist... |
|---|----------|--------------|------------------------|
| **1** | Is there a public GitHub repository with active development? | Search `github.com/[project-name]` | 🚨 **STOP.** No code = no product. You're buying marketing, not technology. |
| **2** | Can I find an independent smart contract audit from a known firm? | Search `[project] audit CertiK Hacken Trail of Bits` | 🚨 **STOP.** Unaudited contracts can drain your wallet or be exploited. |
| **3** | Is the team doxxed with verifiable LinkedIn/professional history? | Cross-reference names, check Companies House/registries | 🚨 **STOP.** Anonymous teams have zero accountability. |
| **4** | Has the presale been running for more than 6 months? | Check Wayback Machine: `web.archive.org/web/*/[domain]` | 🚨 **STOP.** Legitimate projects don't need 2+ years to sell tokens. |
| **5** | Is the token trading on a Tier-1 exchange (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken)? | Check CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap | ⚠️ **CAUTION.** After years of "development," no major listing = no credibility. |
| **6** | Does the Wayback Machine show consistent fundraising numbers? | Compare snapshots 3-6 months apart | 🚨 **STOP.** Resetting counters = fake numbers. |
| **7** | Can I sell my tokens RIGHT NOW for real money? | Try to swap on Uniswap/PancakeSwap | 🚨 **STOP.** "Paper gains" with no liquidity = worthless. |

**Time to complete this checklist: 5-10 minutes.**  
**Potential savings: Your entire investment.**

## The Story Behind This Checklist

I spent weeks investigating a cryptocurrency project that has raised over **$200 million** in a presale lasting more than **2 years**. What I found wasn't just red flags—it was a masterclass in how modern crypto scams operate.

This isn't about naming and shaming. It's about showing you the **exact techniques** I used to investigate, so you can protect yourself and anyone you care about.

---

## Part 1: The First Red Flag I Should Have Seen Immediately

### No GitHub Repository

I started where any technical investigation should: **the code.**

For context, here's what legitimate blockchain projects look like:

| Project | GitHub Stars | Commits | Contributors | Public Code |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Bitcoin | 78,000+ | 36,000+ | 900+ | ✅ Since 2009 |
| Ethereum | 47,000+ | 15,000+ | 700+ | ✅ Since 2014 |
| Kaspa (DAG-based) | 300+ | 2,000+ | 20+ | ✅ Since 2021 |
| **[Investigated Project]** | **N/A** | **0** | **Unknown** | ❌ **None** |

The project claimed to be building a "Layer 1 blockchain" with "revolutionary DAG technology." After **2+ years** and **$200M+ raised**, there is no public repository.

### What This Means

Building a blockchain is one of the most complex software engineering tasks that exists. It requires:
- Consensus mechanism code
- Networking layer
- Virtual machine (for smart contracts)
- Cryptographic primitives
- Node software

**You cannot build this in private and then magically release it.** Every legitimate blockchain has years of public development history.

**🔑 Lesson:** If a "blockchain project" has no public code after months of fundraising, you're not investing in technology—you're investing in a website.

---

## Part 2: The Wayback Machine Reveals Everything

The **Wayback Machine** (web.archive.org) is an investigator's best friend. It shows historical snapshots of any website.

### What I Found

I checked **19 snapshots** of the project's website over 2 years. Here's what I discovered:

#### The "Raised So Far" Counter

| Date | Claimed Amount | What Happened |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| Jan 2024 | $1.0M | Initial launch |
| Mar 2024 | **$0M** | 🚨 **COUNTER RESET #1** |
| May 2024 | $27.2M | Rapid jump |
| Jul 2024 | **$0M** | 🚨 **COUNTER RESET #2** |
| Sep 2024 | **$0M** | 🚨 **COUNTER RESET #3** |
| Oct 2024 | $76.5M | Sudden jump |
| Jan 2026 | $200M+ | Current claim |

**Why would a legitimate project reset their fundraising counter to $0 multiple times?**

There's no innocent explanation. Either:
1. They're lying about how much they've raised
2. They're resetting to create artificial "fresh start" urgency
3. Their entire dashboard is manually controlled, not connected to real transactions

#### The Disappearing Partners

| Date | Partners Shown |
|------|----------------|
| Oct 2024 | Inter Milan, Borussia Dortmund, F1 teams |
| Jan 2025 | **BVB logo GONE** |
| Jan 2026 | **Only minor sports teams remain** |

Major partners don't just disappear unless contracts defaulted or the "partnerships" were never real.

### How to Do This Yourself

1. Go to `web.archive.org`
2. Enter the project's domain
3. Click on dates 3-6 months apart
4. Screenshot everything
5. Compare: numbers, team, partners, promises

**Time required: 15-30 minutes**  
**Value: Priceless**

## Part 3: The Presale That Never Ends

### Normal Presale Timeline

| Phase | Typical Duration |
|-------|------------------|
| Private sale | 1-4 weeks |
| Public presale | 2-8 weeks |
| Token Generation Event (TGE) | Fixed date, announced in advance |
| Exchange listing | Within weeks of TGE |

### This Project's Timeline

| Date | Status |
|------|--------|
| Nov 2023 | Presale begins (as "Euler Network") |
| Jan 2024 | Rebrand to current name, presale continues |
| ... | |
| Jan 2026 | **STILL IN PRESALE** |

**Duration: 26+ months and counting**

For comparison:
- Ethereum's ICO: **42 days** (2014)
- EOS (longest legitimate ICO): **341 days** (2017-2018)
- **This project: 780+ days**

### Why Endless Presales Are a Red Flag

An endless presale means:
1. **No accountability** - Can't fail if you never "launch"
2. **Infinite fundraising** - Why stop when money keeps flowing?
3. **No real product** - A working product would be more profitable than presale
4. **Ponzi dynamics** - Later investors pay earlier investors' "returns"

**🔑 Lesson:** If a presale has lasted more than a year, something is very wrong.

## Part 4: The Psychology They're Using Against You

Understanding these tactics won't just help you spot scams—it'll help you understand why smart people fall for them.

### Tactic 1: Artificial Scarcity

> "ONLY 3.55 BILLION COINS LEFT!"  
> "BATCH 26 SELLING OUT!"  
> "LAST CHANCE BEFORE PRICE INCREASE!"

**Reality check:** They control the supply. There's no actual scarcity.

### Tactic 2: Bonus Escalation

| Month | Bonus Offered |
|-------|---------------|
| Early 2024 | 50% (BDAG50) |
| Late 2024 | 100% (BULLRUN100) |
| Late 2024 | 250% (BDAG250) |
| 2025 | 500%+ "Mystery Boxes" |

**If the product was valuable, would they need to give away 500% extra?**

### Tactic 3: The Referral Pyramid

> "REFER FRIENDS & EARN 6-10% IN USDT!"

When a project pays you in stablecoins to bring in new investors, that's not marketing—it's a recruitment incentive. Your job becomes finding their next victim.

### Tactic 4: The Moving Target

Every time you ask "when mainnet?", the answer changes:
- "Q2 2024" → "Q4 2024" → "2025" → "Soon" → "Daily AMAs until TGE"

**If they could launch, they would have. They can't.**

---

## Part 5: The Community Is Weaponized

### How They Silence Critics

1. **Label them "FUD spreaders"** - Anyone with concerns is a "paid shill"
2. **Ban them quickly** - Dissent is removed within hours
3. **Reward defenders** - Aggressive supporters become moderators
4. **Create us vs. them** - "Diamond hands vs. paper hands"

### The "Identity Trap"

Once you've:
- Told friends about your investment
- Posted on social media
- Convinced others to invest
- Defended it publicly

...admitting it's a scam means admitting you:
- Were wrong
- Potentially hurt people you care about
- Lost money that's not coming back

**This is why victims often become the loudest defenders.**

---

## Part 6: What I Wish Investors Had Asked

Before investing, if anyone had spent 10 minutes asking:

1. ❌ "Where's the GitHub?" → No answer
2. ❌ "Who audited the contracts?" → No answer
3. ❌ "Why has the presale lasted 2 years?" → Deflection
4. ❌ "Why do fundraising numbers reset?" → Banned for asking
5. ❌ "Can I sell my tokens today?" → No

**The information was always there. The questions just weren't being asked.**

---

## Part 7: The 5-Minute Due Diligence Routine

Do this for EVERY crypto investment:

### Step 1: GitHub Check (1 minute)
```
→ Search: github.com/[project-name]
→ Look for: Recent commits, multiple contributors, open issues
→ Red flag: No repo, or repo with only documentation/no code
```

### Step 2: Wayback Machine (2 minutes)
```
→ Go to: web.archive.org/web/*/[project-domain]
→ Check: 3 snapshots from different months
→ Red flag: Changing numbers, disappearing partners, shifting dates
```

### Step 3: Audit Search (1 minute)
```
→ Search: "[project] smart contract audit"
→ Look for: PDF from CertiK, Hacken, Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin
→ Red flag: No audit, or only "internal audit"
```

### Step 4: Liquidity Check (1 minute)
```
→ Try: Add token to Uniswap/PancakeSwap
→ Check: Is there actual liquidity?
→ Red flag: Can't sell, or would lose 50%+ to slippage
```

### Step 5: The "Why" Question (30 seconds)
```
→ Ask yourself: Why would this be underpriced?
→ If thousands of people know about it, why isn't it already pumped?
→ Red flag: "Early opportunity" that's been "early" for 2 years
```

## Part 8: Resources If You've Been Scammed

**It's not your fault.** Professional scammers spend their entire lives perfecting these techniques.

| Resource | Purpose | Link |
|----------|---------|------|
| FBI IC3 | Report internet crime | ic3.gov |
| FTC | File fraud complaints | reportfraud.ftc.gov |
| SEC | Report securities fraud | sec.gov/tcr |
| r/CryptoScams | Community support | reddit.com/r/CryptoScams |
| Revoke.cash | Revoke token approvals | revoke.cash |

## Conclusion: The Best Investment Advice I Can Give

**The best crypto investment you'll ever make is the one you didn't make after 5 minutes of research.**

Scammers rely on:
- Your excitement
- Your FOMO
- Your trust
- Your lack of verification

**They cannot survive scrutiny.** A simple GitHub check, a Wayback Machine search, or a question about liquidity collapses most scams instantly.

The project I investigated raised $200M+ because people didn't ask basic questions. This article exists so you can.

**Save this checklist. Share it. Use it.**
