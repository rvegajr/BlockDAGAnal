# I Investigated a $200M+ Crypto Project. Here's the 5-Minute Checklist That Could Have Saved Investors Millions.

*A practical guide born from a real investigation into BlockDAG/Euler Network*

## 🚨 TL;DR: The 7 Questions That Expose 90% of Crypto Scams

Before you invest a single dollar, ask these questions. **If any answer is "no" or "I can't find it," that's not a yellow flag—it's a red one.**

| # | Question | How to Check | If It Doesn't Exist... |
|---|----------|--------------|------------------------|
| **1** | Is there a public GitHub repository with active development? | Search `github.com/[project-name]` | 🚨 **STOP.** No code = no product. You're buying marketing, not technology. |
| **2** | Can I find an independent smart contract audit from a known firm? | Search `[project] audit CertiK Hacken Trail of Bits` | 🚨 **STOP.** Unaudited contracts can drain your wallet or be exploited. |
| **3** | Is the team doxxed with verifiable LinkedIn/professional history? | Cross-reference names, check Companies House/registries | 🚨 **STOP.** Anonymous teams have zero accountability. |
| **4** | Has the presale been running for more than 6 months? | Check Wayback Machine: `web.archive.org/web/*/[domain]` | 🚨 **STOP.** Legitimate projects don't need 2+ years to sell tokens. |
| **5** | Is the token trading on a Tier-1 exchange (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken)? | Check CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap | ⚠️ **CAUTION.** After years of "development," no major listing = no credibility. |
| **6** | Does the Wayback Machine show consistent fundraising numbers? | Compare snapshots 3-6 months apart | 🚨 **STOP.** Resetting counters = fake numbers. |
| **7** | Can I sell my tokens RIGHT NOW for real money? | Try to swap on Uniswap/PancakeSwap | 🚨 **STOP.** "Paper gains" with no liquidity = worthless. |

**Time to complete this checklist: 5-10 minutes.**  
**Potential savings: Your entire investment.**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: Sophisticated Scams Check These Boxes Too

**The project I investigated claimed to have audits, a doxxed team, and hit roadmap milestones for a year.** They created the *illusion* of legitimacy.

The basic checklist catches lazy scams. For sophisticated ones, you need **VERIFICATION, not just claims:**

| They Claim... | You Must Verify... |
|---------------|---------------------|
| "We have audits" | **Can you read the full PDF on CertiK/Hacken's OFFICIAL website?** Not their site—the auditor's site. |
| "I founded this project" | **Can you verify this independently?** Check Wayback Machine for earliest mentions. The CEO in this investigation claimed to have "created" the project, but evidence suggests it was rebranded from a different project (Euler Network) before he appeared. Origin stories can be fabricated. |
| "Tier-1 exchange coming" | **Did it happen?** Promises are worthless. Check CoinGecko for actual listings. |
| "We hit our roadmap" | **Can you USE what they built?** A testnet announcement ≠ a working blockchain. |
| "Major partnerships" | **Are those logos still there 6 months later?** Disappearing partners = failed or fake deals. |

**Scammers have evolved. Your due diligence must evolve too.**

## The Story Behind This Checklist

I spent weeks investigating a cryptocurrency project that has raised over **$200 million** in a presale lasting more than **2 years**. What I found wasn't just red flags—it was a masterclass in how modern crypto scams operate.

This isn't about naming and shaming. It's about showing you the **exact techniques** I used to investigate, so you can protect yourself and anyone you care about.

---

## Part 1: The First Red Flag I Should Have Seen Immediately

### No GitHub Repository

I started where any technical investigation should: **the code.**

For context, here's what legitimate blockchain projects look like:

| Project | GitHub Stars | Commits | Contributors | Public Code |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Bitcoin | 78,000+ | 36,000+ | 900+ | ✅ Since 2009 |
| Ethereum | 47,000+ | 15,000+ | 700+ | ✅ Since 2014 |
| Kaspa (DAG-based) | 300+ | 2,000+ | 20+ | ✅ Since 2021 |
| **[Investigated Project]** | **N/A** | **0** | **Unknown** | ❌ **None** |

The project claimed to be building a "Layer 1 blockchain" with "revolutionary DAG technology." After **2+ years** and **$200M+ raised**, there is no public repository.

### What This Means

Building a blockchain is one of the most complex software engineering tasks that exists. It requires:
- Consensus mechanism code
- Networking layer
- Virtual machine (for smart contracts)
- Cryptographic primitives
- Node software

**You cannot build this in private and then magically release it.** Every legitimate blockchain has years of public development history.

**🔑 Lesson:** If a "blockchain project" has no public code after months of fundraising, you're not investing in technology—you're investing in a website.

---

## Part 2: The Wayback Machine Reveals Everything

The **Wayback Machine** (web.archive.org) is an investigator's best friend. It shows historical snapshots of any website.

### What I Found

I checked **19 snapshots** of the project's website over 2 years. Here's what I discovered:

#### The "Raised So Far" Counter

| Date | Claimed Amount | What Happened |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| Jan 2024 | $1.0M | Initial launch |
| Mar 2024 | **$0M** | 🚨 **COUNTER RESET #1** |
| May 2024 | $27.2M | Rapid jump |
| Jul 2024 | **$0M** | 🚨 **COUNTER RESET #2** |
| Sep 2024 | **$0M** | 🚨 **COUNTER RESET #3** |
| Oct 2024 | $76.5M | Sudden jump |
| Jan 2026 | $200M+ | Current claim |

**Why would a legitimate project reset their fundraising counter to $0 multiple times?**

There's no innocent explanation. Either:
1. They're lying about how much they've raised
2. They're resetting to create artificial "fresh start" urgency
3. Their entire dashboard is manually controlled, not connected to real transactions

#### The Disappearing Partners

| Date | Partners Shown |
|------|----------------|
| Oct 2024 | Inter Milan, Borussia Dortmund, F1 teams |
| Jan 2025 | **BVB logo GONE** |
| Jan 2026 | **Only minor sports teams remain** |

Major partners don't just disappear unless contracts defaulted or the "partnerships" were never real.

### How to Do This Yourself

1. Go to `web.archive.org`
2. Enter the project's domain
3. Click on dates 3-6 months apart
4. Screenshot everything
5. Compare: numbers, team, partners, promises

**Time required: 15-30 minutes**  
**Value: Priceless**

---

## Part 3: The Presale That Never Ends

### Normal Presale Timeline

| Phase | Typical Duration |
|-------|------------------|
| Private sale | 1-4 weeks |
| Public presale | 2-8 weeks |
| Token Generation Event (TGE) | Fixed date, announced in advance |
| Exchange listing | Within weeks of TGE |

### This Project's Timeline

| Date | Status |
|------|--------|
| Nov 2023 | Presale begins (as "Euler Network") |
| Jan 2024 | Rebrand to current name, presale continues |
| ... | |
| Jan 2026 | **STILL IN PRESALE** |

**Duration: 26+ months and counting**

For comparison:
- Ethereum's ICO: **42 days** (2014)
- EOS (longest legitimate ICO): **341 days** (2017-2018)
- **This project: 780+ days**

### Why Endless Presales Are a Red Flag

An endless presale means:
1. **No accountability** - Can't fail if you never "launch"
2. **Infinite fundraising** - Why stop when money keeps flowing?
3. **No real product** - A working product would be more profitable than presale
4. **Ponzi dynamics** - Later investors pay earlier investors' "returns"

**🔑 Lesson:** If a presale has lasted more than a year, something is very wrong.

---

## Part 4: The Psychology They're Using Against You

Understanding these tactics won't just help you spot scams—it'll help you understand why smart people fall for them.

### Tactic 1: Artificial Scarcity

> "ONLY 3.55 BILLION COINS LEFT!"  
> "BATCH 26 SELLING OUT!"  
> "LAST CHANCE BEFORE PRICE INCREASE!"

**Reality check:** They control the supply. There's no actual scarcity.

### Tactic 2: Bonus Escalation

| Month | Bonus Offered |
|-------|---------------|
| Early 2024 | 50% (BDAG50) |
| Late 2024 | 100% (BULLRUN100) |
| Late 2024 | 250% (BDAG250) |
| 2025 | 500%+ "Mystery Boxes" |

**If the product was valuable, would they need to give away 500% extra?**

### Tactic 3: The Referral Pyramid

> "REFER FRIENDS & EARN 6-10% IN USDT!"

When a project pays you in stablecoins to bring in new investors, that's not marketing—it's a recruitment incentive. Your job becomes finding their next victim.

### Tactic 4: The Moving Target

Every time you ask "when mainnet?", the answer changes:
- "Q2 2024" → "Q4 2024" → "2025" → "Soon" → "Daily AMAs until TGE"

**If they could launch, they would have. They can't.**

---

## Part 5: The Community Is Weaponized

### How They Silence Critics

1. **Label them "FUD spreaders"** - Anyone with concerns is a "paid shill"
2. **Ban them quickly** - Dissent is removed within hours
3. **Reward defenders** - Aggressive supporters become moderators
4. **Create us vs. them** - "Diamond hands vs. paper hands"

### The "Identity Trap"

Once you've:
- Told friends about your investment
- Posted on social media
- Convinced others to invest
- Defended it publicly

...admitting it's a scam means admitting you:
- Were wrong
- Potentially hurt people you care about
- Lost money that's not coming back

**This is why victims often become the loudest defenders.**

---

## Part 6: The Sophistication Problem - When Scammers Check the Boxes

Here's what makes modern scams dangerous: **They've learned the checklist too.**

The project I investigated didn't ignore due diligence—they created the **illusion** of passing it.

### What They Did Right (On Paper)

| Red Flag | What They Claimed | The Reality |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Smart Contract Audit** | ✅ "Independently audited" displayed on website | ⚠️ **Unverifiable.** No link to actual audit report. No CertiK/Hacken verification page. "We have audits" ≠ audits exist. |
| **Doxxed Team / Origin Story** | ✅ CEO claims "I created BlockDAG" | ⚠️ **Fabricated history.** Wayback Machine shows the project existed as "Euler Network" (Nov-Dec 2023) before "BlockDAG" appeared (Jan 2024). The CEO claims founding the project, but evidence suggests it was rebranded. **Origin stories can be lies.** |
| **Tier-1 Exchange Listings** | ✅ "Coming to major exchanges" promised repeatedly | ❌ **Never happened.** After 2+ years, only minor exchanges. Promises ≠ delivery. |
| **Product Roadmap** | ✅ Benchmarks hit consistently for ~1 year | ⚠️ **Minimum viable deception.** Testnet, app mockups, keynotes—enough to maintain belief, not enough to be a real product. |
| **Partnerships** | ✅ Inter Milan, Borussia Dortmund, F1 logos | ❌ **Logos disappeared.** Alleged contract defaults. Partnerships were marketing, not technology. |

### The "Minimum Viable Legitimacy" Strategy

This is the evolution of crypto scams. They do just enough to:

1. **Pass surface-level due diligence** - "Look, they have audits!"
2. **Create plausible deniability** - "We're working on it, delays happen"
3. **Build trust over time** - Hit small milestones for a year before the cracks show
4. **Exhaust skeptics** - Critics give up after being proven "wrong" multiple times

### The Deeper Questions You Must Ask

The basic checklist catches lazy scams. For sophisticated ones, you need **verification**:

| Surface Check | Deep Verification |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "They have audits" | **Can I read the full audit PDF on CertiK/Hacken's official site?** |
| "Team is doxxed" | **When did this person join? Were they there from day one? Who REALLY controls the treasury?** |
| "They promised Tier-1 listings" | **Did any listing actually happen? Promises are worthless.** |
| "They hit their roadmap" | **Are the deliverables real products or just announcements? Can I USE what they built?** |
| "They have big partnerships" | **Are the partner logos still there 6 months later? Did the partners confirm the relationship?** |

### The Fabricated Origin Story Problem

One of the most insidious tactics: **claiming to have founded a project you didn't create.**

In this investigation:
- The CEO (Anthony Turner) publicly claims he **"created BlockDAG"**
- Wayback Machine evidence shows a project called **"Euler Network"** existed Nov-Dec 2023
- "BlockDAG" appeared in January 2024, **25 days after** the last Euler Network snapshot
- The app mockup showing "168.0341" mined balance appears on **BOTH** sites
- Reddit users claim to have invested in "Euler Network" in November 2023

**If the origin story doesn't match the archives, someone is lying.**

This matters because:
1. A "founder" who didn't actually found the project may be a **hired spokesperson**
2. A rebrand often happens to **escape bad reputation** from a failed/exposed project
3. The **real controllers** remain hidden while the public face takes attention

**How to verify:**
```
1. Wayback Machine the project's domain
2. Check for EARLIEST snapshot
3. Compare claimed founding date vs. actual first appearance
4. Search for alternative project names in the same timeframe
5. Look for identical assets (logos, app mockups, numbers) across projects
```

### The Trust Timeline Pattern

Here's what the investigation revealed about how they built (and exploited) trust:

```
YEAR 1: BUILD TRUST
├── Hit small milestones consistently
├── Release testnet/app mockups  
├── Announce partnerships (real or inflated)
├── Small delays, always delivered eventually
└── Skeptics look foolish, believers feel validated

YEAR 2: EXPLOIT TRUST
├── Major promises delayed indefinitely
├── Partnerships quietly disappear
├── Bonus codes escalate (50% → 100% → 500%)
├── "TGE coming soon" becomes permanent status
└── Skeptics already left, only believers remain
```

**The first year wasn't the scam. The first year was building the trust they'd later exploit.**

---

## Part 7: What I Wish Investors Had Asked

Before investing, if anyone had spent 10 minutes asking:

1. ❌ "Where's the GitHub?" → No answer
2. ❌ "Who audited the contracts?" → No answer
3. ❌ "Why has the presale lasted 2 years?" → Deflection
4. ❌ "Why do fundraising numbers reset?" → Banned for asking
5. ❌ "Can I sell my tokens today?" → No

**The information was always there. The questions just weren't being asked.**

---

## Part 7: The 5-Minute Due Diligence Routine

Do this for EVERY crypto investment:

### Step 1: GitHub Check (1 minute)
```
→ Search: github.com/[project-name]
→ Look for: Recent commits, multiple contributors, open issues
→ Red flag: No repo, or repo with only documentation/no code
```

### Step 2: Wayback Machine (2 minutes)
```
→ Go to: web.archive.org/web/*/[project-domain]
→ Check: 3 snapshots from different months
→ Red flag: Changing numbers, disappearing partners, shifting dates
```

### Step 3: Audit Search (1 minute)
```
→ Search: "[project] smart contract audit"
→ Look for: PDF from CertiK, Hacken, Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin
→ Red flag: No audit, or only "internal audit"
```

### Step 4: Liquidity Check (1 minute)
```
→ Try: Add token to Uniswap/PancakeSwap
→ Check: Is there actual liquidity?
→ Red flag: Can't sell, or would lose 50%+ to slippage
```

### Step 5: The "Why" Question (30 seconds)
```
→ Ask yourself: Why would this be underpriced?
→ If thousands of people know about it, why isn't it already pumped?
→ Red flag: "Early opportunity" that's been "early" for 2 years
```

## Part 8: Resources If You've Been Scammed

**It's not your fault.** Professional scammers spend their entire lives perfecting these techniques.

| Resource | Purpose | Link |
|----------|---------|------|
| FBI IC3 | Report internet crime | ic3.gov |
| FTC | File fraud complaints | reportfraud.ftc.gov |
| SEC | Report securities fraud | sec.gov/tcr |
| r/CryptoScams | Community support | reddit.com/r/CryptoScams |
| Revoke.cash | Revoke token approvals | revoke.cash |

---

## Part 9: Lessons Learned - What This Investigation Taught Me

After weeks of deep investigation, these are the truths I'll carry forward:

---

### Lesson 1: Scammers Are Professionals. You're an Amateur.

This isn't an insult—it's physics. 

Scammers spend **100% of their time** perfecting deception. You spend maybe **1% of your time** on due diligence before investing. They will always be better at lying than you are at detecting lies.

**The only equalizer:** Tools like Wayback Machine that capture truth before it can be hidden.

---

### Lesson 2: The Illusion of Legitimacy Is the Product

BlockDAG didn't fail to build a product. **The illusion WAS the product.**

- Audits that can't be verified? Product.
- A CEO with a fabricated origin story? Product.
- Roadmap milestones that are announcements, not software? Product.
- Partnership logos that disappear? Product.

They're not selling technology. They're selling **the feeling** that you're early to something real.

---

### Lesson 3: Year One Is the Setup. Year Two Is the Heist.

The first year of consistent delivery wasn't them "building trust" accidentally. It was **strategic investment** in credibility they'd later cash out.

Every milestone hit in Year One made it harder for investors to question Year Two delays. The trust they built became the trap they sprung.

**If a project is in its second year of presale, you're not early—you're the exit liquidity.**

---

### Lesson 4: Your Identity Becomes Their Shield

The moment you:
- Tell friends about your investment
- Post about it publicly
- Defend it against critics
- Convince others to invest

...you've made the scam part of your identity. Now admitting fraud means admitting you were fooled AND that you led others astray.

**Scammers don't just take your money—they recruit you as an unpaid defender.**

---

### Lesson 5: "FUD" Is How They Silence Truth

Any legitimate project welcomes scrutiny. Only frauds need to silence questions.

When every concern is labeled "FUD" and every questioner is banned, the community isn't protecting the project—**it's protecting the scam from exposure.**

**Red flag:** If asking hard questions gets you banned, you have your answer.

---

### Lesson 6: The Wayback Machine Is Your Best Friend

Every lie leaves a trace. Scammers can change their website, but they can't change the archives.

In this investigation, the Wayback Machine revealed:
- 3 separate fundraising counter resets
- A complete rebrand from "Euler Network" to "BlockDAG"
- Identical app mockups proving the connection
- Disappearing partnership logos
- Escalating bonus desperation

**None of this was visible on the current website. All of it was preserved in the archives.**

---

### Lesson 7: Verification ≠ Existence

The question isn't "Do they CLAIM to have audits?"  
The question is "Can I READ the audit on the AUDITOR'S website?"

The question isn't "Is the team DOXXED?"  
The question is "Can I VERIFY their origin story independently?"

The question isn't "Did they PROMISE Tier-1 exchanges?"  
The question is "Did the listings ACTUALLY HAPPEN?"

**Claims are free. Verification is truth.**

---

### Lesson 8: Bonus Escalation = Desperation

When bonuses go from 50% → 100% → 250% → 500%, that's not generosity. That's a project that can't attract new money without increasingly absurd incentives.

**A good product doesn't need to give away 500% extra to find buyers.**

---

### Lesson 9: If You Can't Sell, You Don't Own Anything

"Paper gains" on a dashboard mean nothing if:
- The token isn't listed anywhere
- There's no liquidity to sell into
- The only "price" is what the project claims

**Real ownership = ability to sell RIGHT NOW for real money.**

If you can't do that, you own numbers on a screen, not an asset.

---

### Lesson 10: The 5-Minute Check Would Have Saved Everyone

None of this investigation required special access or skills. Everything I found used:
- Wayback Machine (free, public)
- Google searches
- Reddit
- Basic blockchain explorers

**The information was always there. The questions just weren't being asked.**

---

### The Meta-Lesson: Why This Keeps Working

Crypto scams persist because they exploit:

| Human Trait | How It's Exploited |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Greed** | "10x gains! Early opportunity!" |
| **FOMO** | "Last chance! Selling out fast!" |
| **Trust** | "Major partnerships! Audited! Doxxed team!" |
| **Community** | "We're all in this together!" |
| **Identity** | "Diamond hands! Don't be weak!" |
| **Hope** | "TGE coming soon! Just hold!" |

These aren't flaws—they're human nature. Scammers have simply learned to weaponize them.

**The defense isn't becoming inhuman. It's building systems (checklists, verification steps) that work even when your emotions don't.**

---

### What I'll Do Differently

1. **Wayback Machine BEFORE investing** - Not after I suspect something
2. **Verify, don't trust** - Claims mean nothing without independent confirmation
3. **Watch bonus escalation** - If incentives keep increasing, something's wrong
4. **Check for liquidity** - Can I sell TODAY?
5. **Question the origin story** - When did this person ACTUALLY join?
6. **Set a time limit** - If presale > 6 months, I'm out
7. **Never recruit others** - The moment I'm recruiting, I've become the scam's agent

---

## Conclusion: The Best Investment Advice I Can Give

**The best crypto investment you'll ever make is the one you didn't make after 5 minutes of research.**

Scammers rely on:
- Your excitement
- Your FOMO
- Your trust
- Your lack of verification

**They cannot survive scrutiny.** A simple GitHub check, a Wayback Machine search, or a question about liquidity collapses most scams instantly.

The project I investigated raised $200M+ because people didn't ask basic questions. This article exists so you can.

**Save this checklist. Share it. Use it.**

---

## TL;DR Checklist (Print This)

### Level 1: Basic Checks (Catches Lazy Scams)
```
□ GitHub repo exists with real code and recent commits?
□ Independent security audit published?
□ Team has public identities?
□ Presale under 6 months?
□ Listed on major exchange?
□ Wayback Machine shows consistent data?
□ Can I actually sell my tokens right now?

If any box is unchecked: DO NOT INVEST.
```

### Level 2: Verification Checks (Catches Sophisticated Scams)
```
□ Can I find the audit PDF on the AUDITOR'S website (not project's)?
□ Can I INDEPENDENTLY verify the founder's origin story? (Wayback Machine their claims!)
□ Does the project have a different name/brand in earlier archives?
□ Have promised Tier-1 listings ACTUALLY HAPPENED (not just announced)?
□ Can I USE the product they claim to have built (not just see announcements)?
□ Are partnership logos from 6+ months ago STILL on the website?
□ Has the "TGE date" been pushed back more than twice?
□ Are bonus percentages INCREASING over time (50% → 100% → 500%)?

⚠️ CRITICAL: People can LIE about being founders. Wayback Machine their story.

If any Level 2 box fails: VERIFY DEEPER BEFORE INVESTING.
```

### The Trust Timeline Question
```
Ask yourself: Is this project in "trust building" mode or "trust exploitation" mode?

YEAR 1 SIGNS (Trust Building):
- Hitting small milestones
- Growing community organically
- Reasonable bonus offers
- Clear, achievable timelines

YEAR 2+ SIGNS (Trust Exploitation):
- Major promises indefinitely delayed
- Partners quietly disappearing  
- Escalating bonus desperation (500%+)
- "TGE coming soon" for months/years
- Critics banned, only believers remain

If you see Year 2 signs: THE EXPLOITATION PHASE HAS BEGUN.
```
