# 🎭 How to Build a $200M Crypto Empire (Satirical Guide)

## A Totally Fictional, Definitely-Not-Real Business Plan for "SchlockFAG"

### ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

**This is SATIRE.** This document exists solely to educate investors about how sophisticated crypto scams operate by walking through the playbook step-by-step. Every technique described here has been observed in real projects. If you recognize these patterns, run.

**Do not actually do any of this.** It's illegal, immoral, and you'll probably end up in prison or worse.

# Part 0: Why I Wrote This (A Personal Confession)

## My Own Crypto Graveyard

Before I walk you through how scams work, let me establish my credentials: **I am a certified crypto idiot.**

I've lost money in ways that would make a financial advisor weep:

### 🎰 The Timing Gambler Phase
I thought I could time the market. Buy low, sell high. Simple, right?

**Reality:** I bought high, panicked, sold low. Then watched it go back up. Then bought high again. Repeat until broke.

**Lesson learned:** The market doesn't care about your spreadsheets.

### 🤖 The Robot Trader Phase
"I'll build an automated trading bot! Remove the emotion!"

I spent weeks coding, backtesting, optimizing. My bot was going to make me rich while I slept.

**Reality:** The bot executed my bad ideas faster and more efficiently than I ever could. It lost money at scale.

**Lesson learned:** Automating stupidity just makes you stupid faster.

### 💨 The BluntzLoinz Debacle

Then I became a **partial developer** on a project called **BluntzLoinz**.

Yes, that was the actual name. No, I didn't pick it.

I watched from the inside as the project slowly collapsed. I saw the Discord messages, the "temporary setbacks," the pivot promises. I experienced a paltry, almost comical rug pull.

But here's what I gained: **I saw the psychology from the inside.**

I watched believers become defenders. I watched skeptics get labeled as FUD. I watched the cope evolve in real-time. I was part of the machine, and I saw how the gears turned.

**Lesson learned:** Even being inside doesn't protect you. It just gives you a better view of the trainwreck.

---

## Then I Watched My Friend Get Captured

This is where it gets personal.

### Meet Youchef Peed Flavous

Youchef is smart. Successful. Not the kind of person you'd expect to fall for anything.

He found SchlockFAG (or whatever it was actually called) and became a true believer.

### Meet Shiz PanderShot

Another friend. Also invested. Also believed.

### And Then There Was Me

Youchef tried to get me in. He was excited. He wanted to share the opportunity.

But I was burned. I didn't want to. I'd seen too much.

So I started asking questions:

**Me:** "Where's the GitHub?"  
**Youchef:** "They're keeping it private for security."

**Me:** "The code seems undeveloped. Nothing's published."  
**Youchef:** "You don't understand the technology."

**Me:** "The whitepaper has sections from other projects..."  
**Youchef:** "Why are you always so negative?"

**Me:** "The presale has been going for two years—"  
**Youchef:** "If you don't believe, just don't invest. Stop spreading FUD."

### The Moment I Stopped Talking

There's a moment when you realize: **they don't want to hear it.**

Every fact I brought up was met with:
- Dismissal
- Mild insult
- Accusations that I "didn't believe"
- Suggestions that I was jealous or scared

So I stopped. I just... listened. I went along for the ride.

And I watched. In real-time. As everyone got boinked.

### What I Saw

I watched the excitement phase.  
I watched the doubt-suppression phase.  
I watched the "any day now" phase.  
I watched the anger-at-critics phase.  
I watched the slow realization phase.  
I watched the grief phase.

**I couldn't stop it. They had to see it themselves.**

---

## Why This Document Exists

I can't go back and save my BluntzLoinz investment.  
I can't go back and make Youchef listen.  
I can't undo any of it.

But I can write down exactly how these things work.

Not from the outside, as a critic.  
Not from academic research.  
From someone who **was inside a failed project** and **watched friends get captured by another one.**

If even ONE person reads this satirical "how-to guide" and thinks:

*"Wait... this sounds familiar..."*

Then it was worth writing.

---

## A Note on the Satire

Everything that follows is presented as a fictional "business plan" for a fake crypto called **SchlockFAG**.

The humor is dark. The details are specific. The patterns are real.

If you find yourself thinking "this is too specific to be made up"... that's the point.

Now, let's build a fake empire together.

---

# 🚀 Executive Summary

**Company:** SchlockFAG (Sherlock Financial Awesome Group)  
**Tagline:** "Elementary, My Dear Investor"  
**Goal:** Raise $200M+ while delivering absolutely nothing  
**Timeline:** 24-36 months of "presale" followed by strategic disappearance  
**Exit Strategy:** Seychelles

---

# Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1-2)

## Step 1.1: Acquire a Dead Crypto Project

**Budget: $5,000-$50,000**

Why build when you can rebrand? Find a failed crypto project with:
- Existing codebase (doesn't need to work)
- Some Wayback Machine history
- Abandoned social media accounts
- A whitepaper you can plagiarize

**Pro tip:** The original founders are usually desperate. They'll sell for pennies.

**Example naming evolution:**
```
Original: "EuselessChain" (failed 2023)
    ↓
Rebrand: "SchlockFAG" (2024)
    ↓
If needed: "SFAG Network" (2025)
    ↓
If really needed: "Schlock Protocol" (2026)
```

**Total spent so far: $25,000**

---

## Step 1.2: Domain & Infrastructure Setup

**Budget: $2,000**

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| schlockfag.io | $15/year | The .io makes it legit |
| schlockfag.network | $12/year | Backup domain |
| AWS hosting | $200/month | For the "tech" |
| Figma subscription | $15/month | For "product mockups" |
| Canva Pro | $13/month | For endless infographics |

**Critical:** Delete the Wayback Machine traces of the old project. Just kidding—you can't. But most investors won't check anyway.

---

## Step 1.3: Create the "Technology"

**Budget: $0-$10,000**

### Option A: Fork an existing blockchain
- Fork Ethereum/Polygon/whatever
- Change the name in the code
- Claim it's "revolutionary"

### Option B: Just don't build anything
- Create a whitepaper with GPT-4
- Add lots of diagrams
- Use words like "DAG," "hybrid consensus," "Layer 1.5"
- Reference academic papers nobody will read

### Option C: The Whitepaper Remix (Highly Recommended)

Why write original research when you can... *borrow*?

**The SchlockFAG Whitepaper Recipe:**
```
Page 1-3:   Copy Kaspa's DAG explanation (change "Kaspa" to "SchlockFAG")
Page 4-7:   Paste Bitcoin's consensus section (add "hybrid" before everything)
Page 8-12:  Steal Ethereum's smart contract overview (call them "Schlock Contracts")
Page 13-15: Grab Solana's throughput claims (triple the numbers)
Page 16:    Add "revolutionary" and "groundbreaking" every other sentence
Page 17:    Incomprehensible math diagrams (looks smart, means nothing)
Page 18:    "References" to papers nobody will actually check
```

**Pro tip:** Academic papers use complex language. Investors don't read them. They just see "whitepaper exists" and move on.

**When someone notices the plagiarism:** "Great minds think alike. We're building on the shoulders of giants."

```

**The software shows pretty numbers. It connects to nothing. The miners generate heat and electricity bills. That's it.**

---

### The "Radical Transparency" Lie

**Our official position:** "SchlockFAG is committed to radical transparency and open collaboration with the community."

**Our actual code repository:**
```
github.com/schlockfag
├── README.md (last updated 18 months ago)
├── whitepaper.pdf (plagiarized, see above)
├── logo.png
└── coming-soon.txt
```

**When asked about source code:**
- "Security audit is ongoing, we can't publish yet"
- "Mainnet code will be open-sourced after launch"
- "Our innovative algorithm is proprietary for competitive reasons"
- "The code is available to qualified partners under NDA"

**Translation:** There is no code. Or the code does nothing. Or the code is stolen from somewhere else.

**The beautiful irony:** We use the word "transparent" constantly while showing absolutely nothing. The community will repeat "they're very transparent" because we told them we are.

---

# Phase 2: The Team (Month 2-3)

## Step 2.0: The Man Behind the Curtain

**Meet Merkan Fleasaloz** — our *actual* operator.

You'll never see his name on the website. He's not the CEO. He's not on the advisory board. He doesn't do interviews. But he:

- Controls the wallets
- Makes the real decisions  
- Has done this before (allegedly)
- Knows which jurisdictions don't extradite
- Has a "network" of previous ventures (all mysteriously defunct)

**Merkan's Previous Hits:**
- 🎰 "LuckyCoin Casino" (2019) — users couldn't withdraw
- 🐱 "Big Whiskers Token" (2021) — cat-themed, rug-pulled
- 💳 "FastPay Digital Bank" (2022) — regulatory warning issued
- 🎮 "GameFi Revolution" (2023) — team "stepped back"

**The pattern:** Launch → Hype → Extract → Disappear → Rebrand → Repeat

**Why this matters:** The "CEO" is the fall guy. Merkan is the architect. When things collapse, the CEO faces the music while Merkan is already working on the next project.

---

## Step 2.1: Hire a "CEO" (The Public Face)

**Budget: $50,000-$150,000/year (or equity that's worth $0)**

Requirements:
- ✅ Willing to be the face
- ✅ Can speak confidently about nothing
- ✅ Previous failed ventures (shows "experience")
- ✅ Will sign an NDA about the real operation
- ✅ Expendable when regulators come knocking
- ✅ Doesn't know about Merkan

**Pro tip:** The CEO doesn't need to know anything. In fact, it's better if they don't. Plausible deniability. When the CEO says "I had no idea," they might actually be telling the truth.

---

## Step 2.2: The Advisory Board

**Budget: $0 (equity only)**

| Title | Real Job |
|-------|----------|
| "Chief Technology Officer" | Changed a WordPress theme once |
| "Blockchain Architect" | Read the Bitcoin whitepaper |
| "Head of Security" | Has a VPN |
| "Strategic Advisor" | Will retweet for tokens |
| "Gaming Industry Veteran" | Played Fortnite professionally |

**Important:** Get professional headshots. LinkedIn profiles. Make them "doxxed" so the community feels safe.

---

## Step 2.3: The Corporate Shell Game

**Budget: $5,000-$20,000**

Register multiple entities in different jurisdictions:

```
SchlockFAG Ltd. (UK) ← CEO is listed here (expendable)
    ↓ "Provides technology to"
SFAG Holdings (BVI) ← Nominee directors only
    ↓ "Licensed by"
Schlock Systems AG (Switzerland) ← Sounds legitimate
    ↓ "Operated by"
Digital Schlock LLC (Delaware) ← Privacy-friendly
    ↓ "Funds held by"
SFAG Foundation (Seychelles) ← Merkan's wallet access
    ↓ "Advised by"
Fleasaloz Family Trust (Nevis) ← Where the money actually goes
```

**When regulators ask who's responsible:** "That's a different entity."

**When investors ask who's responsible:** "That's a different entity."

**When anyone asks anything:** "That's a different entity."

**When they try to trace the funds:** Good luck. You'll need lawyers in 6 jurisdictions.

**Merkan's name appears on:** Nothing. He's a "consultant" to an "advisory firm" that "provides services" to one of the shells. Technically, he's never touched the project.

---

# Phase 3: Building "Legitimacy" (Month 3-6)

## Step 3.1: The PR Blitz

**Budget: $50,000-$100,000**

### Chainwire Package (Gold - $13,699)
- 100+ guaranteed articles
- CoinTelegraph coverage ✓
- The Block coverage ✓
- "In Collaboration With" badge ✓

### MediaX Package (Diamond - $12,500)
- CoinTelegraph ✓
- NewsBTC ✓
- Be[in]crypto ✓

### Misc PR ($25,000)
- Jerusalem Post "partnership content"
- Forbes "contributor" article
- Benzinga sponsored content
- 50 more crypto blogs nobody reads

**Result:** Google "SchlockFAG" and see 100+ "news" articles!

### Sample Headlines We'll Pay For:
- "SchlockFAG CEO Reveals Revolutionary Approach to Blockchain"
- "Why SchlockFAG Could Be the Next Ethereum"
- "Inside SchlockFAG: The Visionary Project Taking Crypto by Storm"
- "SchlockFAG Partners with Major Sports Team" (we'll get to this)

**Remember:** Every article has a tiny disclosure at the bottom. Nobody reads the bottom.

---

## Step 3.2: The Sports Partnership Illusion

**Budget: $500,000-$2,000,000**

| "Partnership" | Cost | Reality |
|---------------|------|---------|
| F1 Team logo | $800K | Their logo on our site, not our logo on their car |
| Soccer club "deal" | $1.2M | One Instagram post + rights to say "official partner" |
| NBA player endorsement | $500K | 3 tweets, will delete later |

**The play:** Pay for the partnership. Announce it everywhere. When they don't renew (because we won't pay), just... don't mention it. Quietly remove the logo. The articles stay on Google forever.

---

## Step 3.3: The Audit Theatre

**Budget: $30,000-$100,000**

Get a "security audit" from a firm that:
- Has a professional website
- Will audit code that doesn't do anything
- Won't ask uncomfortable questions
- Will produce a PDF we can display

**The PDF goes on OUR website only.** If anyone asks for it on the auditor's site... stall.

---

# Phase 4: The Presale Engine (Month 4-24)

## Step 4.1: The Counter That Lies

**Budget: $500 (JavaScript developer on Fiverr)**

```javascript
// Presale progress indicator
function displayFundsRaised() {
    const baseAmount = 75000000; // Start at $75M (why not?)
    const randomDaily = Math.random() * 500000;
    const fakeTotal = baseAmount + (daysSinceLaunch * randomDaily);
    
    document.getElementById('raised').innerHTML = 
        '$' + fakeTotal.toLocaleString();
}

// Run every page load
displayFundsRaised();
```

**Wayback Machine will catch the resets.** But by the time anyone checks, we'll have their money.

### The Counter Reset Schedule:
- Month 1: "$0 raised" → "$15M raised"
- Month 4: Reset to "$0" (nobody notices)
- Month 5: "$50M raised"
- Month 8: Reset to "$2M" (called "new batch")
- Month 12: "$150M raised"
- Month 18: "$247M raised"
- Month 24: "TGE IMMINENT!"

---

## Step 4.2: Pricing Psychology

### The Batch System

| Batch | Price | "Discount" | Reality |
|-------|-------|------------|---------|
| 1 | $0.001 | "Founder pricing!" | We keep all of it |
| 5 | $0.005 | "Early bird!" | We keep all of it |
| 15 | $0.015 | "Still early!" | We keep all of it |
| 27 | $0.022 | "Don't miss out!" | We keep all of it |
| 43 | $0.0178 | "Special promotion!" | Wait, it went down? |
| 50 | $0.0234 | "Final batch!" | We keep all of it |

**Pro tip:** Occasionally LOWER the price. Creates urgency ("they're doing a sale!") and confuses anyone tracking.

---

## Step 4.3: The Bonus Escalation

```
Month 1:  "Buy now get 10% bonus!"
Month 3:  "Buy now get 50% bonus!"
Month 6:  "Buy now get 100% bonus!"
Month 12: "Buy now get 250% bonus!"
Month 18: "Buy now get 500% MEGA BONUS!"
Month 24: "Buy now get 1000% ULTRA BONUS!"
```

**The math:** If you're giving 1000% bonus, the token is worth 1/11th what they paid. But the numbers are big and exciting!

---

# Phase 5: The Miner Scheme (Month 6-18)

## Step 5.1: Source Cheap Hardware

**Budget: $500,000 initial inventory**

| Item | Our Cost | Customer Price | Markup |
|------|----------|----------------|--------|
| Generic ASIC (Alibaba) | $350 | $999 | 185% |
| "Pro" Mining Rig | $700 | $2,499 | 257% |
| "Enterprise" Node | $1,200 | $4,999 | 316% |

**Total units sold:** 5,000  
**Revenue:** $8,000,000+  
**Actual mining capability:** Zero. The network doesn't exist.

---

## Step 5.2: The Mining Software

```python
# schlockfag_miner.py - The Illusion Engine

import random
import time

def simulate_mining():
    while True:
        fake_hashrate = random.uniform(90, 150)
        fake_coins = random.uniform(0.1, 5.0)
        
        print(f"⛏️ Hashrate: {fake_hashrate:.2f} TH/s")
        print(f"💰 Mined: {fake_coins:.4f} SFAG")
        print(f"🌐 Block: #{random.randint(800000, 900000)}")
        print("=" * 40)
        
        # Display "pending balance" that can never be withdrawn
        global pending_balance
        pending_balance += fake_coins
        
        time.sleep(60)

# When user tries to withdraw:
def withdraw():
    return "Network synchronizing. Please try again after mainnet launch."
```

**The miners run. They make noise. They use electricity. They display numbers. They mine absolutely nothing.**

---

## Step 5.3: Handling "Where Are My Coins?"

**Support Script:**

> "Thank you for contacting SchlockFAG Support! Your mined SFAG tokens are securely stored in your mining wallet. They will become transferable once mainnet launches. Current estimated launch: Q3 2025."

**Q3 2025 arrives:**

> "Thank you for your patience! Mainnet launch has been rescheduled to Q1 2026 to ensure maximum security and stability."

**Q1 2026 arrives:**

> "Exciting news! We're implementing groundbreaking new features that require additional development time. New launch window: Q3 2026."

**Repeat until exit.**

---

# Phase 6: Community Management (Ongoing)

## Step 6.1: The Telegram/Discord Playbook

### Moderator Instructions:

```
IF user asks about:
    - "When TGE?" → "Coming soon! Focus on accumulating!"
    - "Where's the code?" → "Security reasons. Trust the team."
    - "Why counter reset?" → "New batch system! More opportunity!"
    - "Can I sell?" → [MUTE FOR 24 HOURS]
    - "This seems like a scam" → [BAN IMMEDIATELY]
    
IF user says:
    - "I bought more!" → "🚀 Whale alert! This is the way!"
    - "My miner arrived!" → "Welcome to the family! 💎🙌"
    - "FUD" about anything → "Paid trolls trying to shake out weak hands"
```

---

## Step 6.2: Divide and Conquer

When criticism emerges, deploy community weapons:

### Strategy A: The Shill Army
- 50 fake accounts praising the project
- Drown out criticism with enthusiasm
- "I've done my research and I trust the team!"

### Strategy B: The FUD Label
- Anyone critical = "paid FUD spreader"
- "Competitors are scared!"
- "If you don't believe, just leave!"

### Strategy C: The Insider Leak
- "I heard from a source that [major exchange] listing is happening"
- Creates excitement, distracts from problems
- When it doesn't happen: "NDA, they couldn't announce yet"

### Strategy D: Turn Them Against Each Other
- Seed doubt about prominent community critics
- "I heard [critic name] is working for a competitor"
- Watch the community tear itself apart

---

# Phase 7: The Endgame (Month 24-36)

## Option A: The Soft Exit

**Timeline:** Gradually reduce communication over 6 months

1. CEO "steps back for personal reasons"
2. Communication becomes sporadic
3. Website stops updating
4. Support tickets go unanswered
5. Eventually... silence

**Meanwhile, Merkan Fleasaloz:** Already registered "SchlockFAG 2.0" domains three months ago. New whitepaper (same plagiarized content, new name) ready to go.

**Advantage:** Plausible deniability. "The project failed, it happens."

---

## Option B: The "Hack"

**Timeline:** One dramatic event

1. Announce "security breach"
2. All funds "stolen" by "unknown hackers"
3. File police report (for appearances)
4. Express deep regret
5. Disappear

**Advantage:** Sympathy. "They were victims too!"

---

## Option C: The Pivot

**Timeline:** Ongoing

1. Never actually launch
2. Keep "developing"
3. Launch "SchlockFAG 2.0"
4. Reset everything
5. Start the presale again

**Advantage:** Can continue indefinitely

---

## Option D: The Token Launch (Risky)

**Timeline:** If forced to deliver something

1. Actually launch a token
2. Team dumps on day 1
3. Price crashes 99%
4. Claim "market conditions"
5. Gradually abandon

**Risk:** Leaves evidence. Not recommended.

---

# 🎓 What This Teaches Investors

## If You Recognized These Patterns, GOOD.

Everything in this satirical guide has been observed in real crypto projects. The red flags are:

### 🚩 The Checklist

- [ ] No public GitHub repository
- [ ] Presale lasting more than 6 months
- [ ] "Funds raised" counter that resets
- [ ] Bonus percentages that keep increasing
- [ ] Every news article is sponsored content
- [ ] Sports partnerships that quietly disappear
- [ ] Can't sell or withdraw tokens
- [ ] Complex corporate structure across jurisdictions
- [ ] TGE date that keeps moving
- [ ] Critics get banned, not answered
- [ ] Whitepaper contains text from other projects (Kaspa, Ethereum, etc.)
- [ ] Claims "transparency" but publishes no source code
- [ ] The person doing interviews isn't the one controlling the funds
- [ ] Project has a suspiciously similar predecessor with a different name

### 🔍 The 5-Minute Check

1. **GitHub** → Does actual code exist? Not just a README?
2. **Wayback Machine** → Do the numbers change? Did the project have a different name?
3. **Scroll to bottom of articles** → "Written in cooperation with"?
4. **Try to sell** → Can you actually exit?
5. **Ask a hard question in Telegram** → Answered or banned?
6. **Whitepaper** → Copy a unique sentence, paste into Google. Does it appear in another project's whitepaper?
7. **Corporate structure** → Can you identify ONE person legally responsible for the funds?

---

# 🎭 Final Note

**This document is satire.**

It exists because the best way to protect yourself from manipulation is to understand exactly how it works. When you can see the machinery behind the magic trick, the illusion loses its power.

If you've invested in a project that matches this playbook... I'm sorry. But it's not too late to ask questions.

The information is always there. You just have to look.
