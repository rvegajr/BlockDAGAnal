# 🎭 How to Build a $200M Crypto Empire (Satirical Guide)

## A Totally Fictional, Definitely-Not-Real Business Plan for "SchlockFAG"

### ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

**This is SATIRE.** This document exists solely to educate investors about how sophisticated crypto scams operate by walking through the playbook step-by-step. Every technique described here has been observed in real projects. If you recognize these patterns, run.

**Do not actually do any of this.** It's illegal, immoral, and you'll probably end up in prison or worse.

---

# 🚀 Executive Summary

**Company:** SchlockFAG (Sherlock Financial Awesome Group)  
**Tagline:** "Elementary, My Dear Investor"  
**Goal:** Raise $200M+ while delivering absolutely nothing  
**Timeline:** 24-36 months of "presale" followed by strategic disappearance  
**Exit Strategy:** Seychelles

# Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1-2)

## Step 1.1: Acquire a Dead Crypto Project

**Budget: $5,000-$50,000**

Why build when you can rebrand? Find a failed crypto project with:
- Existing codebase (doesn't need to work)
- Some Wayback Machine history
- Abandoned social media accounts
- A whitepaper you can plagiarize

**Pro tip:** The original founders are usually desperate. They'll sell for pennies.

**Example naming evolution:**
```
Original: "EulerChain" (failed 2023)
    ↓
Rebrand: "SchlockFAG" (2024)
    ↓
If needed: "SFAG Network" (2025)
```

**Total spent so far: $25,000**

---

## Step 1.2: Domain & Infrastructure Setup

**Budget: $2,000**

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| schlockfag.io | $15/year | The .io makes it legit |
| schlockfag.network | $12/year | Backup domain |
| AWS hosting | $200/month | For the "tech" |
| Figma subscription | $15/month | For "product mockups" |
| Canva Pro | $13/month | For endless infographics |

**Critical:** Delete the Wayback Machine traces of the old project. Just kidding—you can't. But most investors won't check anyway.

---

## Step 1.3: Create the "Technology"

**Budget: $0-$10,000**

### Option A: Fork an existing blockchain
- Fork Ethereum/Polygon/whatever
- Change the name in the code
- Claim it's "revolutionary"

### Option B: Just don't build anything
- Create a whitepaper with GPT-4
- Add lots of diagrams
- Use words like "DAG," "hybrid consensus," "Layer 1.5"
- Reference academic papers nobody will read

### Option C: The Mining Illusion (Our Approach)

```

**The software shows pretty numbers. It connects to nothing. The miners generate heat and electricity bills. That's it.**

---

# Phase 2: The Team (Month 2-3)

## Step 2.1: Hire a "CEO"

**Budget: $50,000-$150,000/year (or equity that's worth $0)**

Requirements:
- ✅ Willing to be the face
- ✅ Can speak confidently about nothing
- ✅ Previous failed ventures (shows "experience")
- ✅ Will sign an NDA about the real operation
- ✅ Expendable when regulators come knocking

**Pro tip:** The CEO doesn't need to know anything. In fact, it's better if they don't. Plausible deniability.

---

## Step 2.2: The Advisory Board

**Budget: $0 (equity only)**

| Title | Real Job |
|-------|----------|
| "Chief Technology Officer" | Changed a WordPress theme once |
| "Blockchain Architect" | Read the Bitcoin whitepaper |
| "Head of Security" | Has a VPN |
| "Strategic Advisor" | Will retweet for tokens |
| "Gaming Industry Veteran" | Played Fortnite professionally |

**Important:** Get professional headshots. LinkedIn profiles. Make them "doxxed" so the community feels safe.

---

## Step 2.3: The Corporate Shell Game

**Budget: $5,000-$20,000**

Register multiple entities in different jurisdictions:

```
SchlockFAG Ltd. (UK)
    ↓ "Provides technology to"
SFAG Holdings (BVI)
    ↓ "Licensed by"
Schlock Systems AG (Switzerland)
    ↓ "Operated by"
Digital Schlock LLC (Delaware)
    ↓ "Funds held by"
SFAG Foundation (Seychelles)
```

**When regulators ask who's responsible:** "That's a different entity."

**When investors ask who's responsible:** "That's a different entity."

**When anyone asks anything:** "That's a different entity."

---

# Phase 3: Building "Legitimacy" (Month 3-6)

## Step 3.1: The PR Blitz

**Budget: $50,000-$100,000**

### Chainwire Package (Gold - $13,699)
- 100+ guaranteed articles
- CoinTelegraph coverage ✓
- The Block coverage ✓
- "In Collaboration With" badge ✓

### MediaX Package (Diamond - $12,500)
- CoinTelegraph ✓
- NewsBTC ✓
- Be[in]crypto ✓

### Misc PR ($25,000)
- Jerusalem Post "partnership content"
- Forbes "contributor" article
- Benzinga sponsored content
- 50 more crypto blogs nobody reads

**Result:** Google "SchlockFAG" and see 100+ "news" articles!

### Sample Headlines We'll Pay For:
- "SchlockFAG CEO Reveals Revolutionary Approach to Blockchain"
- "Why SchlockFAG Could Be the Next Ethereum"
- "Inside SchlockFAG: The Visionary Project Taking Crypto by Storm"
- "SchlockFAG Partners with Major Sports Team" (we'll get to this)

**Remember:** Every article has a tiny disclosure at the bottom. Nobody reads the bottom.

---

## Step 3.2: The Sports Partnership Illusion

**Budget: $500,000-$2,000,000**

| "Partnership" | Cost | Reality |
|---------------|------|---------|
| F1 Team logo | $800K | Their logo on our site, not our logo on their car |
| Soccer club "deal" | $1.2M | One Instagram post + rights to say "official partner" |
| NBA player endorsement | $500K | 3 tweets, will delete later |

**The play:** Pay for the partnership. Announce it everywhere. When they don't renew (because we won't pay), just... don't mention it. Quietly remove the logo. The articles stay on Google forever.

---

## Step 3.3: The Audit Theatre

**Budget: $30,000-$100,000**

Get a "security audit" from a firm that:
- Has a professional website
- Will audit code that doesn't do anything
- Won't ask uncomfortable questions
- Will produce a PDF we can display

**The PDF goes on OUR website only.** If anyone asks for it on the auditor's site... stall.

---

# Phase 4: The Presale Engine (Month 4-24)

## Step 4.1: The Counter That Lies

**Budget: $500 (JavaScript developer on Fiverr)**

```javascript
// Presale progress indicator
function displayFundsRaised() {
    const baseAmount = 75000000; // Start at $75M (why not?)
    const randomDaily = Math.random() * 500000;
    const fakeTotal = baseAmount + (daysSinceLaunch * randomDaily);
    
    document.getElementById('raised').innerHTML = 
        '$' + fakeTotal.toLocaleString();
}

// Run every page load
displayFundsRaised();
```

**Wayback Machine will catch the resets.** But by the time anyone checks, we'll have their money.

### The Counter Reset Schedule:
- Month 1: "$0 raised" → "$15M raised"
- Month 4: Reset to "$0" (nobody notices)
- Month 5: "$50M raised"
- Month 8: Reset to "$2M" (called "new batch")
- Month 12: "$150M raised"
- Month 18: "$247M raised"
- Month 24: "TGE IMMINENT!"

---

## Step 4.2: Pricing Psychology

### The Batch System

| Batch | Price | "Discount" | Reality |
|-------|-------|------------|---------|
| 1 | $0.001 | "Founder pricing!" | We keep all of it |
| 5 | $0.005 | "Early bird!" | We keep all of it |
| 15 | $0.015 | "Still early!" | We keep all of it |
| 27 | $0.022 | "Don't miss out!" | We keep all of it |
| 43 | $0.0178 | "Special promotion!" | Wait, it went down? |
| 50 | $0.0234 | "Final batch!" | We keep all of it |

**Pro tip:** Occasionally LOWER the price. Creates urgency ("they're doing a sale!") and confuses anyone tracking.

---

## Step 4.3: The Bonus Escalation

```
Month 1:  "Buy now get 10% bonus!"
Month 3:  "Buy now get 50% bonus!"
Month 6:  "Buy now get 100% bonus!"
Month 12: "Buy now get 250% bonus!"
Month 18: "Buy now get 500% MEGA BONUS!"
Month 24: "Buy now get 1000% ULTRA BONUS!"
```

**The math:** If you're giving 1000% bonus, the token is worth 1/11th what they paid. But the numbers are big and exciting!

---

# Phase 5: The Miner Scheme (Month 6-18)

## Step 5.1: Source Cheap Hardware

**Budget: $500,000 initial inventory**

| Item | Our Cost | Customer Price | Markup |
|------|----------|----------------|--------|
| Generic ASIC (Alibaba) | $350 | $999 | 185% |
| "Pro" Mining Rig | $700 | $2,499 | 257% |
| "Enterprise" Node | $1,200 | $4,999 | 316% |

**Total units sold:** 5,000  
**Revenue:** $8,000,000+  
**Actual mining capability:** Zero. The network doesn't exist.

---

## Step 5.2: The Mining Software

```python
# schlockfag_miner.py - The Illusion Engine

import random
import time

def simulate_mining():
    while True:
        fake_hashrate = random.uniform(90, 150)
        fake_coins = random.uniform(0.1, 5.0)
        
        print(f"⛏️ Hashrate: {fake_hashrate:.2f} TH/s")
        print(f"💰 Mined: {fake_coins:.4f} SFAG")
        print(f"🌐 Block: #{random.randint(800000, 900000)}")
        print("=" * 40)
        
        # Display "pending balance" that can never be withdrawn
        global pending_balance
        pending_balance += fake_coins
        
        time.sleep(60)

# When user tries to withdraw:
def withdraw():
    return "Network synchronizing. Please try again after mainnet launch."
```

**The miners run. They make noise. They use electricity. They display numbers. They mine absolutely nothing.**

---

## Step 5.3: Handling "Where Are My Coins?"

**Support Script:**

> "Thank you for contacting SchlockFAG Support! Your mined SFAG tokens are securely stored in your mining wallet. They will become transferable once mainnet launches. Current estimated launch: Q3 2025."

**Q3 2025 arrives:**

> "Thank you for your patience! Mainnet launch has been rescheduled to Q1 2026 to ensure maximum security and stability."

**Q1 2026 arrives:**

> "Exciting news! We're implementing groundbreaking new features that require additional development time. New launch window: Q3 2026."

**Repeat until exit.**

---

# Phase 6: Community Management (Ongoing)

## Step 6.1: The Telegram/Discord Playbook

### Moderator Instructions:

```
IF user asks about:
    - "When TGE?" → "Coming soon! Focus on accumulating!"
    - "Where's the code?" → "Security reasons. Trust the team."
    - "Why counter reset?" → "New batch system! More opportunity!"
    - "Can I sell?" → [MUTE FOR 24 HOURS]
    - "This seems like a scam" → [BAN IMMEDIATELY]
    
IF user says:
    - "I bought more!" → "🚀 Whale alert! This is the way!"
    - "My miner arrived!" → "Welcome to the family! 💎🙌"
    - "FUD" about anything → "Paid trolls trying to shake out weak hands"
```

---

## Step 6.2: Divide and Conquer

When criticism emerges, deploy community weapons:

### Strategy A: The Shill Army
- 50 fake accounts praising the project
- Drown out criticism with enthusiasm
- "I've done my research and I trust the team!"

### Strategy B: The FUD Label
- Anyone critical = "paid FUD spreader"
- "Competitors are scared!"
- "If you don't believe, just leave!"

### Strategy C: The Insider Leak
- "I heard from a source that [major exchange] listing is happening"
- Creates excitement, distracts from problems
- When it doesn't happen: "NDA, they couldn't announce yet"

### Strategy D: Turn Them Against Each Other
- Seed doubt about prominent community critics
- "I heard [critic name] is working for a competitor"
- Watch the community tear itself apart

---

# Phase 7: The Endgame (Month 24-36)

## Option A: The Soft Exit

**Timeline:** Gradually reduce communication over 6 months

1. CEO "steps back for personal reasons"
2. Communication becomes sporadic
3. Website stops updating
4. Support tickets go unanswered
5. Eventually... silence

**Advantage:** Plausible deniability. "The project failed, it happens."

---

## Option B: The "Hack"

**Timeline:** One dramatic event

1. Announce "security breach"
2. All funds "stolen" by "unknown hackers"
3. File police report (for appearances)
4. Express deep regret
5. Disappear

**Advantage:** Sympathy. "They were victims too!"

---

## Option C: The Pivot

**Timeline:** Ongoing

1. Never actually launch
2. Keep "developing"
3. Launch "SchlockFAG 2.0"
4. Reset everything
5. Start the presale again

**Advantage:** Can continue indefinitely

---

## Option D: The Token Launch (Risky)

**Timeline:** If forced to deliver something

1. Actually launch a token
2. Team dumps on day 1
3. Price crashes 99%
4. Claim "market conditions"
5. Gradually abandon

**Risk:** Leaves evidence. Not recommended.

# 🎓 What This Teaches Investors

## If You Recognized These Patterns, GOOD.

Everything in this satirical guide has been observed in real crypto projects. The red flags are:

### 🚩 The Checklist

- [ ] No public GitHub repository
- [ ] Presale lasting more than 6 months
- [ ] "Funds raised" counter that resets
- [ ] Bonus percentages that keep increasing
- [ ] Every news article is sponsored content
- [ ] Sports partnerships that quietly disappear
- [ ] Can't sell or withdraw tokens
- [ ] Complex corporate structure across jurisdictions
- [ ] TGE date that keeps moving
- [ ] Critics get banned, not answered

### 🔍 The 5-Minute Check

1. **GitHub** → Does code exist?
2. **Wayback Machine** → Do the numbers change?
3. **Scroll to bottom of articles** → "Written in cooperation with"?
4. **Try to sell** → Can you actually exit?
5. **Ask a hard question in Telegram** → Answered or banned?

---

# 🎭 Final Note

**This document is satire.**

It exists because the best way to protect yourself from manipulation is to understand exactly how it works. When you can see the machinery behind the magic trick, the illusion loses its power.

If you've invested in a project that matches this playbook... I'm sorry. But it's not too late to ask questions.

The information is always there. You just have to look.
