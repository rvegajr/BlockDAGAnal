## 🎯 Key Takeaways for Investors

### 1. Short-term (Year 1): Expect Losses
All models show negative ROI in Year 1 across all scenarios. This is normal for any vesting-based token launch.

### 2. Medium-term (Years 2-3): Protocol v3.0 Leads
- **Conservative**: Protocol v3.0 reaches **+40% ROI by Year 3**
- **Ideal**: Protocol v3.0 reaches **+208% ROI by Year 3**
- Even with crash overlays, Protocol v3.0 is **breakeven or positive by Year 3**

### 3. Long-term (Years 4-6): Multiple Models Succeed
- **Ideal scenario**: All models show positive returns by Year 6
- **Conservative**: Protocol v3.0 maintains best returns (+27% at Year 6)
- **$100k → $1.3M** is possible in ideal conditions (Original Model, Year 6)

### 4. Best Model by Objective (All 7 Ranked)

| Your Goal | #1 Pick | #2 Pick | #3 Pick | Avoid |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| **Best short-term (Y1-3)** | Protocol v3.0 | Protocol v2.6 | Hybrid Model | Original Model |
| **Best long-term (Y6)** | Original Model | Hybrid Model | Hybrid Tokenomics | Protocol v2.6, v3.1 |
| **Best in crashes** | Protocol v3.0 | Hybrid Model | Original Model | Hybrid B |
| **Lowest brake risk** | Hybrid Tokenomics (20%) | Hybrid B (20%) | Protocol v3.0 (100% but recovers) | — |
| **Overall balance** | **Protocol v3.0** | Hybrid Model | Original Model | Protocol v3.1, Hybrid B |

## ⚠️ Disclaimers

1. **Past performance ≠ future results**: These are simulations based on historical BTC market regimes, not predictions.
2. **Model assumptions**: The "ideal" scenario assumes 50% annual liquidity growth, which requires successful adoption.
3. **Brake/gate risk**: High brake rates mean investors may be "stuck" unable to access tokens during crashes.
4. **Investment risk**: Crypto investments can lose 100% of value. Only invest what you can afford to lose.
