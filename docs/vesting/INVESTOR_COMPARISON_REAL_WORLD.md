**Data source**: BTC historical prices 2015-2024 (10 years of actual crypto market cycles)

## If You Invest Today, What Happens?

This comparison uses **real historical crypto market data** (BTC 2015-2024) to show realistic outcomes across **three scenarios**:

| Scenario | Assumption | Best for |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Conservative** | No adoption growth (stress-test) | Worst-case planning |
| **Ideal** | 50% annual liquidity growth + steady inflows | Successful launch |
| **Choppy + Crashes** | Historical + 10 crash scenarios overlaid | Stress-test with shocks |

## 🎯 Key Takeaways for Investors

### 1. Short-term (Year 1): Expect Losses
All models show negative ROI in Year 1 across all scenarios. This is normal for any vesting-based token launch.

### 2. Medium-term (Years 2-3): Protocol v3.0 Leads
- **Conservative**: Protocol v3.0 reaches **+40% ROI by Year 3**
- **Ideal**: Protocol v3.0 reaches **+208% ROI by Year 3**
- Even with crash overlays, Protocol v3.0 is **breakeven or positive by Year 3**

### 3. Long-term (Years 4-6): Multiple Models Succeed
- **Ideal scenario**: All models show positive returns by Year 6
- **Conservative**: Protocol v3.0 maintains best returns (+27% at Year 6)
- **$100k → $1.3M** is possible in ideal conditions (Original Model, Year 6)

### 4. Best Model by Objective

| Your Goal | Recommended Model | Why |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| **Best risk-adjusted returns** | Protocol v3.0 | Positive earlier, best in crashes |
| **Maximum long-term upside** | Original Model or Hybrid Model | Longer vesting = more upside in growth |
| **Lowest brake/freeze risk** | Hybrid Tokenomics | 2% brake rate vs 44%+ for others |
| **Balance of all factors** | Protocol v3.0 | Best short-to-mid term, solid long-term |

## ⚠️ Disclaimers

1. **Past performance ≠ future results**: These are simulations based on historical BTC market regimes, not predictions.
2. **Model assumptions**: The "ideal" scenario assumes 50% annual liquidity growth, which requires successful adoption.
3. **Brake/gate risk**: High brake rates mean investors may be "stuck" unable to access tokens during crashes.
4. **Investment risk**: Crypto investments can lose 100% of value. Only invest what you can afford to lose.
