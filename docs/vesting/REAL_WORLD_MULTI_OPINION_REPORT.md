# Real-World Multi-Opinion Backtest Report

**Generated**: 2026-01-06T22:31:23.666839

## Methodology

Three independent 'opinions' on the same historical market data:
1. **Conservative (Stress-Test)**: raw historical regimes, no adoption overlay
2. **Ideal (Growth Scenario)**: historical regimes + 50% annual liquidity CAGR + 1% monthly inflow
3. **Choppy Stress Overlay**: historical regimes with 10 choppy crash shocks overlaid

**Investment levels**: $9,000, $50,000, $100,000

**ROI horizons**: 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 months
