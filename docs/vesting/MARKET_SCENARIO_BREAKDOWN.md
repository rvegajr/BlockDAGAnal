| **Liquidity** | $32M | $12.8M (-60%) | $12.8M |
| **Circulating Supply** | ~400M | ~800M | ~4.4B |
| **Price** | $0.05 | $0.016 | $0.0029 |
| **Market Cap** | $20M | $12.8M | $12.8M |
| **Emergency Brake** | ❌ Off | ⚠️ Warning | ✅ Active (Month 9) |
| **Investor Access** | 2% TGE | Frozen | Frozen |

### Timeline

```
Month 1:  Launch at $0.05, 340M circulating
Month 2:  CRASH - Liquidity drops 60% to $12.8M
Month 3:  Price drops to $0.025
Month 6:  Price at $0.012
Month 9:  EMERGENCY BRAKE ACTIVATES - Price at $0.018
Month 12: Price stabilizes at $0.0045
Month 24: Final price $0.0029
```

### Analysis
Emergency brake activated at month 9, preventing further vesting unlocks. Price stabilized at new equilibrium based on reduced liquidity. Mining emissions continued, growing supply while liquidity remained constrained.

---

## Scenario 2: FTX Collapse

**Event**: Exchange collapse 3 months after launch, 70% liquidity drop

### Three-Column Breakdown

| Metric | BEFORE Crash | DURING Crash | AFTER (Month 24) |
|--------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Liquidity** | $32M | $9.6M (-70%) | $9.6M |
| **Circulating Supply** | ~500M | ~600M | ~4.4B |
| **Price** | $0.05 | $0.016 | $0.0022 |
| **Market Cap** | $25M | $9.6M | $9.6M |
| **Emergency Brake** | ❌ Off | ✅ IMMEDIATE | ✅ Active (Month 3) |
| **Investor Access** | 2% TGE | Frozen | Frozen |

### Timeline

```
Month 1:  Launch at $0.05
Month 2:  Normal operations, supply ~450M
Month 3:  FTX-STYLE COLLAPSE - Liquidity drops 70% to $9.6M
          EMERGENCY BRAKE TRIGGERS (Liquidity < $10M threshold)
Month 6:  Price at $0.008
Month 12: Price at $0.0035
Month 24: Final price $0.0022
```

### Analysis
**Fastest emergency brake activation** - triggered by liquidity threshold (<$10M) immediately when collapse occurred. This demonstrates the liquidity-based brake works as designed for exchange failure scenarios.

---

## Scenario 3: COVID Black Swan (WORST CASE)

**Event**: Black swan event 1 month after launch, 80% liquidity drop

### Three-Column Breakdown

| Metric | BEFORE Crash | DURING Crash | AFTER (Month 24) |
|--------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Liquidity** | $32M | $6.4M (-80%) | $6.4M |
| **Circulating Supply** | ~340M | ~400M | ~4.4B |
| **Price** | $0.05 | $0.016 | $0.0015 |
| **Market Cap** | $17M | $6.4M | $6.4M |
| **Emergency Brake** | ❌ Off | ✅ IMMEDIATE | ✅ Active (Month 1) |
| **Investor Access** | 2% TGE | Frozen | Frozen |

### Timeline

```
Month 1:  Launch at $0.05, then BLACK SWAN
          Liquidity drops 80% to $6.4M
          EMERGENCY BRAKE TRIGGERS IMMEDIATELY
Month 3:  Price at $0.010
Month 6:  Price at $0.005
Month 12: Price at $0.0025
Month 24: Final price $0.0015
```

### Analysis
**Most severe scenario tested.** Emergency brake activated within the first month, protecting early investors from catastrophic dumps. Even with protection, price degraded significantly due to continued mining emissions against minimal liquidity.

**Key Insight**: At $6.4M liquidity, even modest circulating supply creates extreme price pressure.

---

## Scenario 4: Gradual Bear Market

**Event**: Slow decline over 12 months, 50% total drop

### Four-Column Timeline

| Metric | Month 1 | Month 6 | Month 12 | Month 24 |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Liquidity** | $32M | $24M | $16M | $16M |
| **Circulating Supply** | 340M | 1.2B | 2.5B | 4.4B |
| **Price** | $0.05 | $0.02 | $0.0064 | $0.0036 |
| **Market Cap** | $17M | $24M | $16M | $16M |
| **Emergency Brake** | ❌ Off | ⚠️ Warning | ✅ Active | ✅ Active |
| **Investor Access** | 2% | ~8% | Frozen | Frozen |

### Timeline

```
Month 1:  Launch at $0.05
Month 3:  Liquidity at $28M, price $0.035
Month 6:  Liquidity at $24M, price $0.02 (WARNING)
Month 9:  Liquidity at $20M, price $0.012
Month 10: EMERGENCY BRAKE ACTIVATES
Month 12: Liquidity at $16M, price $0.0064
Month 24: Final price $0.0036
```

### Analysis
Gradual decline gave the system more time to adapt. Investors had access to ~8% of tokens before brake activated. This scenario shows how the brake handles slow deterioration rather than sudden crashes.

---

## Scenario 5: Bull Run Then Crash

**Event**: Strong growth for 6 months (+100%), then 70% crash

### Four-Column Timeline

| Metric | Month 1 | Month 6 (PEAK) | Month 12 | Month 24 |
|--------|---------|----------------|----------|----------|
| **Liquidity** | $32M | $64M (+100%) | $19.2M | $19.2M |
| **Circulating Supply** | 340M | 900M | 2.5B | 4.4B |
| **Price** | $0.05 | **$0.17** | $0.0077 | $0.0044 |
| **Market Cap** | $17M | **$153M** | $19.2M | $19.2M |
| **Emergency Brake** | ❌ Off | ❌ Off | ✅ Active | ✅ Active |
| **Investor Access** | 2% | ~12% | Frozen | Frozen |

### Timeline

```
Month 1:  Launch at $0.05
Month 3:  BULL RUN - Liquidity at $48M, price $0.08
Month 6:  PEAK - Liquidity at $64M, price $0.17 (3.4x launch!)
Month 7:  CRASH BEGINS - Liquidity drops
Month 9:  Liquidity at $25M, price $0.025
Month 12: EMERGENCY BRAKE ACTIVATES - Price at $0.0077
Month 24: Final price $0.0044
```

### Analysis
**Shows the upside potential.** Peak price reached **$0.17 (3.4x launch price)** before the crash. Investors who sold during the bull run captured significant gains. Those who held saw value protected by emergency brake after crash.

**Key Insight**: Bull markets create opportunities, but the crash is inevitable without sustained utility growth.

---

## Scenario 6: High Volatility (BEST CASE)

**Event**: Multiple 30-40% swings throughout first year

### Four-Column Timeline

| Metric | Month 1 | Month 6 | Month 12 | Month 24 |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Liquidity** | $32M | $38.4M (+20%) | $32M | $38.4M |
| **Circulating Supply** | 340M | 900M | 2.5B | 5.1B |
| **Price** | $0.05 | $0.043 | $0.013 | $0.0075 |
| **Market Cap** | $17M | $38.4M | $32M | $38.4M |
| **Emergency Brake** | ❌ Off | ❌ Off | ❌ Off | ✅ Active |
| **Investor Access** | 2% | ~12% | ~20% | Frozen |

### Timeline

```
Month 1:  Launch at $0.05
Month 2:  Swing down 30%, then recovery
Month 4:  Swing up 40%, then correction
Month 6:  Net positive - Liquidity at $38.4M
Month 8:  Another swing cycle
Month 12: Price at $0.013, still above brake threshold
Month 15: EMERGENCY BRAKE ACTIVATES
Month 24: Final price $0.0075 (15% of target)
```

### Analysis
**Best-performing scenario.** Higher average liquidity throughout the period helped maintain price stability longer. Emergency brake delayed until month 15, giving investors maximum access (~20%) before protection kicked in.

**Key Insight**: Volatility with net-positive liquidity is manageable. The swings create trading opportunities while overall trajectory matters most.

---

## Scenario 7: Stable Growth

**Event**: Gradual 20% liquidity increase over 12 months

### Four-Column Timeline

| Metric | Month 1 | Month 6 | Month 12 | Month 24 |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Liquidity** | $32M | $35.2M | $38.4M | $38.4M |
| **Circulating Supply** | 340M | 900M | 2.5B | 5.1B |
| **Price** | $0.05 | $0.039 | $0.015 | $0.0075 |
| **Market Cap** | $17M | $35.2M | $38.4M | $38.4M |
| **Emergency Brake** | ❌ Off | ❌ Off | ❌ Off | ✅ Active |
| **Investor Access** | 2% | ~12% | ~20% | Frozen |

### Timeline

```
Month 1:  Launch at $0.05
Month 3:  Liquidity at $33.6M, price $0.042
Month 6:  Liquidity at $35.2M, price $0.039
Month 9:  Liquidity at $36.8M, price $0.022
Month 12: Liquidity at $38.4M, price $0.015
Month 15: EMERGENCY BRAKE ACTIVATES
Month 24: Final price $0.0075
```

### Analysis
**Important lesson:** Even with steady growth, supply eventually exceeds capacity. The emergency brake still activated at month 15 because circulating supply growth (from mining) outpaced liquidity growth.

**Key Insight**: 20% liquidity growth cannot offset 10.5M/day mining emissions. Need either higher growth rate or emission caps.

---

## Scenario 8: Early Crash with Recovery

**Event**: Crash at month 2 (-50%), recovery by month 6 (+100%)

### Four-Column Timeline

| Metric | Month 1 | Month 2 (CRASH) | Month 6 (RECOVERY) | Month 24 |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Liquidity** | $32M | $16M (-50%) | $32M (recovered) | $32M |
| **Circulating Supply** | 340M | 500M | 900M | 5.1B |
| **Price** | $0.05 | $0.032 | $0.036 | $0.0062 |
| **Market Cap** | $17M | $16M | $32M | $32M |
| **Emergency Brake** | ❌ Off | ⚠️ Warning | ❌ Off | ✅ Active |
| **Investor Access** | 2% | ~4% | ~12% | Frozen |

### Timeline

```
Month 1:  Launch at $0.05
Month 2:  CRASH - Liquidity drops 50% to $16M
          Price drops to $0.032, WARNING state
Month 4:  Recovery begins
Month 6:  FULL RECOVERY - Liquidity back to $32M
          Price at $0.036 (below launch but stable)
Month 12: Price at $0.015
Month 14: EMERGENCY BRAKE ACTIVATES
Month 24: Final price $0.0062
```

### Analysis
**Recovery scenario demonstrates system resilience.** The emergency brake entered warning state but didn't fully activate during the crash because recovery happened quickly. System adapted to changing conditions.

**Key Insight**: Markets that recover can support longer operation before brake activation.

---

## Scenario 9: Late Market Crash

**Event**: Strong growth for 9 months, then crash (-67%)

### Four-Column Timeline

| Metric | Month 1 | Month 6 | Month 9 (CRASH) | Month 24 |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------------|----------|
| **Liquidity** | $32M | $48M (+50%) | $16M (-67%) | $16M |
| **Circulating Supply** | 340M | 900M | 1.8B | 4.4B |
| **Price** | $0.05 | **$0.13** | $0.009 | $0.0036 |
| **Market Cap** | $17M | **$117M** | $16M | $16M |
| **Emergency Brake** | ❌ Off | ❌ Off | ✅ Active | ✅ Active |
| **Investor Access** | 2% | ~15% | Frozen | Frozen |

### Timeline

```
Month 1:  Launch at $0.05
Month 3:  Bull market - Liquidity at $40M, price $0.07
Month 6:  PEAK - Liquidity at $48M, price $0.13 (2.6x launch!)
Month 9:  CRASH - Liquidity drops 67% to $16M
          EMERGENCY BRAKE ACTIVATES
Month 12: Price at $0.0055
Month 24: Final price $0.0036
```

### Analysis
Strong early growth (peak **$0.13**) created significant value for early sellers. Late crash triggered rapid brake activation. By month 9, investors had accessed ~15% of tokens.

**Key Insight**: Strong early performance creates window for value extraction before inevitable correction.

---

## Scenario 10: Multiple Crashes (STRESS TEST)

**Event**: Crashes at months 2, 6, and 12 (-40% each)

### Four-Column Timeline

| Metric | Month 1 | Month 2 | Month 6 | Month 12 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Liquidity** | $32M | $19.2M (-40%) | $11.5M (-40%) | $6.9M (-40%) |
| **Circulating Supply** | 340M | 500M | 900M | 2.5B |
| **Price** | $0.05 | $0.038 | $0.013 | $0.0028 |
| **Market Cap** | $17M | $19.2M | $11.5M | $6.9M |
| **Emergency Brake** | ❌ Off | ⚠️ Warning | ✅ Active | ✅ Active |
| **Investor Access** | 2% | ~4% | Frozen | Frozen |

### Timeline

```
Month 1:  Launch at $0.05
Month 2:  CRASH #1 - Liquidity drops 40% to $19.2M
Month 4:  Partial recovery
Month 6:  CRASH #2 - Liquidity drops 40% to $11.5M
Month 9:  EMERGENCY BRAKE ACTIVATES
Month 12: CRASH #3 - Liquidity drops 40% to $6.9M
          (Already in brake state)
Month 24: Final price $0.0022
```

### Analysis
**Most challenging scenario.** Multiple sequential crashes tested system resilience. Emergency brake activated at month 9, before the third crash, protecting whatever value remained.

**Key Insight**: System handles repeated attacks but cannot prevent value degradation with severely constrained liquidity.

## Recommendations by Scenario Type

### For Early Catastrophic Scenarios

1. **Liquidity Recovery Fund** - Reserve $5-10M for emergency buybacks
2. **Faster Brake Response** - Consider 3-day threshold vs 7-day
3. **Mining Pause Option** - Reduce emissions during crisis

### For Mid-Term Scenarios

1. **Staking Incentives** - Increase rewards during warning state
2. **DAO Emergency Powers** - Allow community vote on emission adjustments
3. **Treasury Burns** - Use reserves to reduce supply

### For All Scenarios

1. **20% Emission Cap** - Limit daily mining to 2.1M tokens
2. **10% Transaction Burns** - Deflationary pressure
3. **90-Day POE Auto-Stake** - Lock mobile mining rewards
4. **Clear Communication** - Explain emergency brake activation to community

---

## Conclusion

The emergency brake system activates in **100% of tested scenarios**, demonstrating it works as designed. The key variables are:

| Factor | Impact on Outcome |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Liquidity stability** | PRIMARY - determines survivability |
| **Time before first crash** | More time = more investor access |
| **Recovery possibility** | Extends runway significantly |
| **Emission controls** | 20% cap improves all scenarios |
| **Staking rate** | Higher = better price stability |

**Bottom Line**: At $32M liquidity, no scenario maintains $0.05 price long-term. The emergency brake's purpose is to **protect remaining value** when conditions deteriorate, not to prevent natural market price discovery.
