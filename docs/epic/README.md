# 🎭 The SchlockFAG Chronicles

## A 9-Part Satirical Epic on Building a $200M Crypto Empire

---

### What Is This?

This is a **satirical series** that walks through exactly how sophisticated crypto scams operate—from the perspective of someone building one.

It's dark humor with a purpose: **education through exposure.**

Every technique described has been observed in real projects. If you recognize these patterns in something you've invested in... I'm sorry.

### The Premise

**SchlockFAG** (Sherlock Financial Awesome Group) is a fictional crypto project that claims to be the "universal solution" for all blockchain problems.

It evolved from **Schlittkoin**, a failed project. Where Schlittkoin was narrow and single-purpose (like a first-generation treatment), SchlockFAG claims to cure everything.

Just like no single pill can cure all diseases, no single blockchain can solve every problem. But that doesn't stop people from selling the dream.
