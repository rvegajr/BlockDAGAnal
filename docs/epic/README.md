# 🎭 The SchlockFAG Chronicles

## A Multi-Part Satirical Epic on Building a $200M Crypto Empire

### *"Like curing ALL STDs with one pill—except it's blockchain, and the pill is empty."*

### What Is This?

This is a **satirical series** that walks through exactly how sophisticated crypto scams operate—from the perspective of someone building one.

It's dark humor with a purpose: **education through exposure.**

Every technique described has been observed in real projects. If you recognize these patterns in something you've invested in... I'm sorry.

### The Premise

**SchlockFAG** (Sherlock Financial Awesome Group) is a fictional crypto project that claims to be the "universal cure" for all blockchain problems.

It evolved from **Schlittkoin**, a failed 2022 project that stored STD test results on the blockchain (yes, really, in our satire). Where Schlittkoin was a "single-target antibiotic" (one narrow use case), SchlockFAG claims to be a "broad-spectrum cure" that solves everything.

The medical analogy runs throughout:
- **First-generation treatments** = Bitcoin, Schlittkoin (single purpose)
- **Multi-drug cocktails** = Ethereum, Solana (multiple features)
- **Universal cure claims** = SchlockFAG (promises everything, delivers nothing)

Just like no single pill can cure all STDs, no single blockchain can solve every problem. But that doesn't stop people from selling the dream.

### The Story

**The Narrator** is a crypto veteran who has:
- Lost money timing the market
- Built a trading bot that automated his losses
- Worked inside a failed project called **BluntzLoinz**
- Watched friends **Youchef Peed Flavous** and **Shiz PanderShot** get captured by a scam
- Tried to warn them, got dismissed, and watched it unfold in real-time

Now he's writing the playbook—not to help scammers, but to show victims exactly what's happening to them.
