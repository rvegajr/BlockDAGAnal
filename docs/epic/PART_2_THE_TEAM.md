# Part 2: The Team

## Meet Merkan Fleasaloz and the Art of Distributed Unaccountability

---

### Previously...

In [Part 1](./PART_1_THE_FOUNDATION.md), we acquired a dead crypto project, plagiarized a whitepaper, built a mining dashboard that connects to nothing, and established our "radically transparent" image.

Now we need people.

---

## The Organizational Philosophy

Before we hire anyone, we need to understand the core principle:

**Nobody should be clearly responsible for anything.**

If regulators come, we need:
- Plausible deniability at every level
- Multiple jurisdictions to navigate
- A clear fall guy who isn't the real operator
- Paper trails that lead in circles

Let's build that.

---

## Step 1: The Man Behind the Curtain

### Meet Merkan Fleasaloz

You won't find Merkan's name on the website. He's not the CEO. He's not on the advisory board. He doesn't do AMAs. He doesn't have a LinkedIn profile associated with SchlockFAG.

But Merkan:
- Controls the wallets
- Makes the real decisions
- Decides when we exit
- Has done this before
- Knows which jurisdictions don't extradite

### Merkan's Previous Ventures

| Year | Project | What Happened |
|------|---------|---------------|
| 2019 | **LuckyCoin Casino** | Users couldn't withdraw. "Technical issues." Site went dark. |
| 2021 | **Big Whiskers Token** | Cat-themed memecoin. Rug pulled at $4M market cap. |
| 2022 | **FastPay Digital Bank** | Regulatory warning issued by Seychelles FSA. Team "restructured." |
| 2023 | **GameFi Revolution** | Team "stepped back to focus on new opportunities." |
| 2024 | **SchlockFAG** | You are here. |

**The Pattern:**
```
Launch → Hype → Extract → Disappear → Rebrand → Repeat
```

Each project teaches lessons. Each exit gets smoother. Each trail gets harder to follow.

### Where Is Merkan?

Officially? He's a "consultant" to an "advisory firm" that "provides services" to one of our shell companies.

Technically, he has never touched SchlockFAG. On paper, he barely knows it exists.

In reality, nothing happens without his approval.

> 📝 **Observer Note:** I tried to trace back who actually controlled the project Youchef invested in. The CEO was public. But the corporate documents led to shells in three different countries. When I asked Youchef who actually controlled the funds, he said, "The team does." I asked, "Which person specifically?" He couldn't answer.

---

## Step 2: The Expendable CEO

### What We Need

Someone to:
- Be the face of the project
- Do AMAs and interviews
- Sign official documents
- Take the blame if things go wrong

Someone who:
- Is charismatic and believable
- Has some legitimate background (but not too much to lose)
- Will sign an NDA
- Ideally doesn't know everything

### The Candidate Profile

**Ideal CEO:**
- Former entrepreneur (preferably with failed ventures—shows "experience")
- Good on camera
- Hungry for a comeback
- Willing to relocate (or work remotely from a convenient jurisdiction)
- Not asking too many questions about corporate structure

**Budget:** $150,000/year + equity (that's worth whatever we say it's worth)

### What the CEO Knows vs. What the CEO Thinks

| The CEO Thinks | The Reality |
|----------------|-------------|
| "I'm leading a revolutionary crypto project" | He's the public-facing distraction |
| "The technology is real" | He's never seen it work |
| "Merkan is a helpful investor" | Merkan runs everything |
| "We're building something legitimate" | We're building an extraction system |
| "I'll get rich from my equity" | His equity is in a company we control |

### The Beautiful Part

When regulators come knocking—and they might—the CEO can truthfully say:

> "I had no idea. I trusted the team. I was deceived too."

He's not lying. He really didn't know. We made sure of it.

**Plausible deniability achieved.**

---

> 📝 **Observer Note:** The CEO of Youchef's project gave regular AMAs. He seemed genuine. Passionate, even. When I suggested he might not be the one actually running things, Youchef said, "Why would someone lie on camera? He'd go to jail." I thought about explaining corporate structures, but I'd already lost him.

---

## Step 3: The Advisory Board

### Purpose

The advisory board exists to add legitimacy. We need names that sound impressive but don't actually do anything.

### The Roster

| Name | Title | Qualifications | Actual Role |
|------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| Dr. Something Something | Chief Technology Officer | PhD in something blockchain-adjacent | Changed a WordPress theme once |
| Alex Chainman | Blockchain Architect | "10 years in crypto" | Read the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2017 |
| Sarah Securitas | Head of Security | "Former cybersecurity consultant" | Has a VPN subscription |
| Mike Tokensworth | Strategic Advisor | "Multiple successful exits" | Will retweet for tokens |
| James Controller | Gaming Industry Veteran | "20 years in gaming" | Played Fortnite professionally |

### Compensation

Advisory board members receive:
- Tokens (from our unlimited supply)
- The title
- Permission to add us to their LinkedIn
- Nothing else

### Key Requirements

Each advisor needs:
- A professional headshot
- A LinkedIn profile
- Willingness to be "doxxed" (makes the community feel safe)
- No intention of actually advising anything

---

## Step 4: The Corporate Shell Game

### Philosophy

The corporate structure serves one purpose: **make it impossible to trace the money.**

If an investigator asks "who's responsible for the funds?"—the answer should be unclear, multi-jurisdictional, and exhausting to untangle.

### The Structure

```
SchlockFAG Ltd. (UK)
│
│   ← CEO is director here (the fall guy)
│   ← This is the "public" company
│
└──→ "Provides technology services to"
     │
     SFAG Holdings (British Virgin Islands)
     │
     │   ← Nominee directors only
     │   ← Owns the intellectual property
     │
     └──→ "Licensed by"
          │
          Schlock Systems AG (Switzerland)
          │
          │   ← Sounds legitimate
          │   ← Nobody knows who owns it
          │
          └──→ "Operated by"
               │
               Digital Schlock LLC (Delaware)
               │
               │   ← US entity for payment processing
               │   ← Privacy-friendly state
               │
               └──→ "Funds held by"
                    │
                    SFAG Foundation (Seychelles)
                    │
                    │   ← "Non-profit" foundation
                    │   ← Merkan has wallet access
                    │
                    └──→ "Advised by"
                         │
                         Fleasaloz Family Trust (Nevis)
                         │
                         ← Where the money actually goes
                         ← Asset protection trust
                         ← Virtually impossible to pierce
```

### When Asked Who's Responsible

| Who Asks | Our Answer |
|----------|------------|
| Investors | "SchlockFAG Ltd. is your counterparty." |
| UK Regulators | "We're just the technology provider. SFAG Holdings owns the IP." |
| BVI Authorities | "We're a holding company. Schlock Systems operates the platform." |
| Swiss Regulators | "We don't handle funds. That's the Foundation." |
| Seychelles FSA | "We're a non-profit foundation. We don't control the technology." |
| Anyone | "That's a different entity." |

### The Cost

| Entity | Setup Cost | Annual Maintenance |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| UK Ltd | $500 | $1,000 |
| BVI Holdings | $2,000 | $1,500 |
| Swiss AG | $5,000 | $3,000 |
| Delaware LLC | $300 | $300 |
| Seychelles Foundation | $3,000 | $1,500 |
| Nevis Trust | $5,000 | $2,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **$15,800** | **$9,300/year** |

For under $20,000, we have a structure that would take years and millions of dollars to unwind legally.

> 📝 **Observer Note:** When DL News investigated the project Youchef invested in, they found entities in the UK, BVI, and Seychelles. Different people were directors of different entities. Nobody seemed to be clearly in charge. The article called it "distributed unaccountability." Youchef dismissed the article as "FUD from competitors."

## Step 5: Team Summary

### What We Tell People

*"Our team is doxxed and transparent. We have experienced advisors from gaming, blockchain, and security. Our CEO does regular AMAs. We're headquartered in the UK with global operations."*

### What Actually Exists

| Role | Public Presence | Actual Control |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| CEO | High (AMAs, interviews) | None (doesn't know full picture) |
| Advisory Board | Medium (LinkedIn, occasional tweets) | None (paid in worthless tokens) |
| Merkan | Zero (name appears nowhere) | Total |

## What We've Built (Cumulative)

**Total investment so far:** ~$75,000

**Total liability exposure for Merkan:** ~$0
