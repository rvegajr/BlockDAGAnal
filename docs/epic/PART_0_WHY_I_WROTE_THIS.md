# Part 0: Why I Wrote This

## A Personal Confession from the Crypto Graveyard

---

### ⚠️ Before We Begin

What follows is my story. It's embarrassing. It's expensive. It's educational.

I'm not writing this as an expert. I'm writing this as someone who has been wrong—spectacularly, repeatedly, expensively wrong—and who then had to watch friends make the same mistakes while being powerless to stop them.

If my failures can save you money, they weren't completely wasted.

## Chapter 1: The Timing Gambler

### "I Can Beat the Market"

It started, like most financial disasters, with confidence.

I'd been watching crypto for months. I saw the patterns. The dips, the pumps, the consolidations. It seemed so *obvious* in hindsight. All I had to do was buy the dips and sell the peaks.

**The Plan:**
```
1. Watch the charts
2. Buy when it dips
3. Sell when it peaks
4. Profit
5. Repeat until rich
```

**The Reality:**

| What I Did | What Happened Next |
|------------|-------------------|
| Bought the "dip" | It dipped more |
| Panic sold the bottom | It immediately recovered |
| FOMO bought the recovery | That was the top |
| Held through the crash | Lost 60% |
| Sold in despair | It pumped 200% the next week |

I did this dance for months. Every time I thought I'd figured out the pattern, the market did something else. 

The charts that looked so obvious in hindsight were completely opaque in real-time. 

**What I learned:** The market doesn't care about your spreadsheets, your trend lines, or your "gut feeling." It will humble you.

**Money lost:** More than I want to admit publicly.

## Chapter 2: The Robot Trader

### "Emotions Are the Problem—I'll Automate!"

After my timing failures, I had a revelation: the problem wasn't my strategy, it was my *emotions*. I panicked at the wrong times. I got greedy at the wrong times.

Solution? **Remove the human.**

I spent weeks building a trading bot:
- Technical indicators ✓
- Entry/exit rules ✓
- Risk management ✓
- Backtested against historical data ✓
- Optimized parameters ✓

The backtest looked *beautiful*. Consistent profits. Minimal drawdowns. I was going to wake up richer every day.

**The Launch:**

I deployed the bot with real money. Watched it make its first trade. Felt smart.

**The Reality:**

The bot did exactly what I programmed it to do.

The problem? I had programmed my bad ideas into it.

```
Human intuition: "This feels like a bad trade"
Bot: "Parameters met. Executing."
Result: Loss

Human intuition: "Maybe I should wait"
Bot: "Signal detected. Buying."
Result: Bought the top

Human intuition: "This is a fake breakout"
Bot: "Breakout confirmed. All in."
Result: Liquidated
```

The bot didn't remove my bad judgment—it *automated* my bad judgment. It executed my flawed logic faster and more efficiently than I ever could.

It lost money at scale. Without emotion. Without hesitation. With perfect consistency.

**What I learned:** Automating stupidity just makes you stupid faster. The problem was never the emotions—it was the underlying strategy.

**Money lost:** [REDACTED]

## Chapter 3: The BluntzLoinz Debacle

### Inside a Failing Project

After the timing disasters and the robot disaster, I thought: maybe I should be on the *other* side. Maybe I should help build something.

That's how I ended up as a **partial developer** on a project called **BluntzLoinz**.

Yes. That was the real name. No, I didn't choose it.

### What BluntzLoinz Was (Supposedly)

The pitch was actually interesting:
- Cannabis-adjacent cryptocurrency
- Loyalty rewards for dispensaries
- "The future of legal weed commerce"

I joined because:
1. The tech seemed achievable
2. I wanted to learn from the inside
3. I was naive

### What I Saw From Inside

Being inside a failing crypto project is like watching a slow-motion car crash from the passenger seat.

**The Discord Evolution:**

*Month 1:*
> "We're building something revolutionary! The team is working 24/7!"

*Month 3:*
> "Small delay on the roadmap. We want to do this right."

*Month 6:*
> "We're pivoting to a better opportunity. This is actually bullish."

*Month 9:*
> "The FUD is coordinated. Real believers know the truth."

*Month 12:*
> [Server archived]

### The Psychology I Witnessed

From inside, I saw how believers became defenders:

1. **Early believers** had genuine excitement
2. **First doubters** were labeled "impatient"
3. **Persistent doubters** were labeled "FUD spreaders"
4. **People who left** were labeled "weak hands"
5. **Those who stayed** became more invested in defending than questioning
6. **By the end**, the community had self-selected into only true believers

The skeptics didn't get convinced—they got *exhausted* and left. The believers didn't get smarter—they got more *entrenched*.

### The Rug

It wasn't dramatic. It wasn't even a proper rug pull in the classic sense.

It was more of a... slow deflation. 

The team stopped updating. The Discord went quiet. The website went down. One day the token was worth something; six months later it wasn't worth anything.

**What I learned:** 

The rug doesn't have to be sudden. Sometimes it's just abandonment dressed up as "development delays."

And here's the thing that haunted me: **I saw it coming.** From the inside, the warning signs were obvious. But the people most invested couldn't see them. Or wouldn't.

**Money lost:** Mostly time. Which might be worse.

## Chapter 4: Watching Friends Get Captured

### Enter: Youchef Peed Flavous

After BluntzLoinz, I was *done*. Burned three times. No more crypto investments. I was out.

Then my friend Youchef Peed Flavous found a project.

Youchef isn't stupid. He's successful. He's analytical. He's exactly the kind of person you wouldn't expect to fall for anything.

But he was *excited*.

"You have to see this project," he told me. "It's different. It's legitimate. They have partnerships with sports teams. They've raised hundreds of millions. It's going to be huge."

### Enter: Shiz PanderShot

Shiz was also in. Another friend. Another smart person. Another believer.

They both tried to get me to invest.

### The Conversations

I didn't want to invest. I was burned. But I also didn't want to be the guy who rains on everyone's parade.

So I asked questions. Gentle questions at first.

---

**Conversation 1: The GitHub**

**Me:** "Hey, have you looked at their GitHub? I couldn't find much code."

**Youchef:** "They keep it private for security reasons. It's a smart move, actually."

**Me:** "But... how do you know the technology works if you can't see it?"

**Youchef:** "They've had audits. The team knows what they're doing."

**Me:** "Which auditors? Can you link me to the audit report?"

**Youchef:** "It's on their website somewhere. Look, do your own research if you don't believe me."

---

**Conversation 2: The Whitepaper**

**Me:** "I was reading their whitepaper. Some of the sections look really similar to other projects."

**Youchef:** "So? All blockchains build on similar concepts. That's how technology works."

**Me:** "No, I mean... literally similar. Like copied."

**Youchef:** "You're reaching. Why are you so determined to find problems?"

---

**Conversation 3: The Presale Duration**

**Me:** "The presale has been going on for almost two years. Doesn't that seem... long?"

**Youchef:** "They're being careful. They want to do it right. Would you rather they rush and fail?"

**Me:** "Most ICOs are like 30 days. This is—"

**Youchef:** "This isn't 'most ICOs.' This is different. If you can't see that, I don't know what to tell you."

---

**Conversation 4: The Counter**

**Me:** "I checked the Wayback Machine. Their 'funds raised' counter seems to have reset a few times."

**Youchef:** "That's just different batches. Different rounds of funding."

**Me:** "But the numbers don't add up. In March it said $50 million, then in June it said $20 million—"

**Youchef:** "Why are you spending so much time trying to prove this is a scam? Seriously, what's your agenda?"

**Me:** "I don't have an agenda, I'm just—"

**Youchef:** "If you don't want to invest, don't invest. But stop spreading FUD to people who actually believe in something."

---

### The Moment I Stopped Talking

There's a specific moment when you realize: **they don't want to hear it.**

It's not that they can't understand your points. It's that engaging with your points threatens something they've invested in—money, yes, but also *identity*.

By that point, Youchef wasn't just invested financially. He was invested *emotionally*. He'd told people about it. He'd recruited friends. He'd defended it in conversations.

Admitting I might be right meant admitting he might be wrong. And that was too expensive.

So I stopped.

I stopped bringing up the GitHub.  
I stopped mentioning the whitepaper.  
I stopped pointing out the counter resets.  
I stopped asking questions.

I just... listened. Nodded. Said "interesting" a lot.

And I watched.

### What I Watched

I had a front-row seat to the entire arc:

**The Excitement Phase:**
> "This is going to change everything. We're so early."

**The Defense Phase:**
> "The critics don't understand the technology. They're just jealous."

**The Delay Justification Phase:**
> "Good things take time. Better to launch right than launch fast."

**The Anger Phase:**
> "The FUD is coordinated. Someone is trying to sabotage us."

**The Bargaining Phase:**
> "Even if the launch is delayed, the fundamentals are strong."

**The Quiet Phase:**
> [Fewer messages about the project]

**The Realization Phase:**
> "I'm starting to have concerns..."

**The Grief Phase:**
> "I can't believe I fell for this."

I watched it all. In real-time. Over months.

I couldn't stop it. **They had to see it themselves.**

## Chapter 5: Why I'm Writing This

### What I Can't Undo

I can't get back my timing losses.  
I can't get back what the bot lost.  
I can't get back my time on BluntzLoinz.  
I can't get back what Youchef and Shiz lost.  
I can't undo any of it.

### What I Can Do

I can write down exactly how this works.

Not as a critic who's never been inside.  
Not as an academic studying from a distance.  
As someone who:

- **Failed** as an investor (multiple times)
- **Saw the machine** from inside a failing project
- **Watched friends** get captured by another one
- **Tried to warn them** and was dismissed
- **Witnessed the entire arc** in real-time

I know how this feels from every angle.

### The Satirical Approach

What follows is presented as a "business plan" for a fictional crypto called **SchlockFAG** (Sherlock Financial Awesome Group).

It's dark. It's specific. It's uncomfortable.

I'm walking you through exactly how to build a crypto scam—not to help scammers, but to help you recognize when you're being scammed.

If you read Part 1 and think *"that sounds like the project I invested in"*...

...that's the point.

---

## A Note to Youchef and Shiz

If you're reading this:

I'm sorry I couldn't find a way to make you hear me.  
I'm sorry I eventually stopped trying.  
I'm sorry I watched and didn't fight harder.

But I also know: you couldn't have heard me. Not then. The psychology was too strong.

Maybe this helps someone else hear it before it's too late.
