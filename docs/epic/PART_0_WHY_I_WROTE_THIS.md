# Part 0: Why I Wrote This

## The Friend I Couldn't Save

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

**This is satire.** What follows is a fictional "how-to guide" for building a crypto scam. Every technique described has been observed in real projects. If you recognize these patterns, run.

## This Isn't Abstract

I didn't write this because I read about scams on Reddit.

I wrote this because I watched my friend **Youchef Peed Flavous** lose money to one. In real-time. While I tried to warn him. While he told me I was spreading FUD.

And I watched another friend, **Shiz PanderShot**, do the same thing. Same project. Same warnings ignored. Same outcome.

I stood on the sidelines with my evidence—the Wayback Machine screenshots, the missing GitHub, the whitepaper plagiarism, the counter resets—and I couldn't make them hear me.

So now I'm writing the playbook. Not for scammers. For victims. 

If you can see how the machine works, maybe you won't get caught in it.

## The Project

I'm going to walk you through how to build a fictional crypto scam called **SchlockFAG** (Sherlock Financial Awesome Group).

It's a parody. The techniques are real. The names are fake. The patterns are everywhere.

SchlockFAG evolved from a failed project called **Schlittkoin**—a narrow, single-purpose blockchain (like a first-generation antibiotic). SchlockFAG claims to be the "universal solution" (like a pill that cures everything). 

Spoiler: There is no universal solution. In medicine or crypto.

## A Note on Youchef

Throughout this series, you'll see **Observer Notes**—moments where I share what Youchef said when confronted with specific evidence.

These aren't meant to mock him. He's smart. Successful. Careful with money.

He still fell for it.

That's the point. These operations are designed by professionals. The victims aren't stupid—they're targeted.
