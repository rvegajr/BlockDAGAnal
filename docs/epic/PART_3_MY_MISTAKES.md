# Part 3: My Mistakes

## How I Earned My Credentials in Failure

### Previously...

In [Part 1](./PART_1_THE_FOUNDATION.md), we built the technical illusion.  
In [Part 2](./PART_2_THE_TEAM.md), we created the untraceable structure.

Before we continue building SchlockFAG, I need to explain how I know all this. It's not from books. It's from **being wrong. Repeatedly. Expensively.**

## Why This Chapter Exists

You might be wondering: "Why should I trust this guy's analysis of scams?"

Fair question. Here's my answer: **I'm not an expert. I'm a survivor.**

I've lost money in crypto through:
- Timing the market (badly)
- Automated trading (worse)
- Working inside a failed project (educational)
- Watching friends ignore warnings (painful)

These failures taught me more than any whitepaper ever could. Let me share them.

## Mistake #1: The Timing Gambler

### "I Can See the Patterns"

I watched charts for months. I saw the dips, the pumps, the consolidations. It seemed *obvious*.

Buy the dip. Sell the peak. Repeat until rich.

**The Plan:**
```
1. Watch the charts
2. Buy when it dips
3. Sell when it peaks
4. Profit
5. Repeat until Lambo
```

**The Reality:**

| What I Did | What Happened |
|------------|---------------|
| Bought the "dip" | It dipped more |
| Panic sold the bottom | Immediately recovered |
| FOMO bought the recovery | That was the top |
| Held through the crash | Lost 60% |
| Sold in despair | Pumped 200% the next week |

I did this dance for months. Every time I thought I'd found the pattern, the market did something else.

**What I Learned:**

The charts that look obvious in hindsight are completely opaque in real-time. The market doesn't care about your spreadsheets.

**Cost:** Several thousand dollars and my confidence.

## Mistake #2: The Robot Trader

### "Emotions Are the Problem—I'll Automate!"

After timing failed, I had a revelation: the problem was my *emotions*. I panicked. I got greedy. I made bad decisions under pressure.

Solution? Remove the human. Build a bot.

**The Development:**
- Weeks of coding
- Technical indicators
- Entry/exit rules
- Risk management
- Backtested on historical data
- Optimized parameters

The backtest looked beautiful. Consistent profits. Minimal drawdowns.

**The Launch:**

I deployed with real money. Watched it make its first trade. Felt smart.

**The Reality:**

The bot did exactly what I programmed it to do.

The problem? I had programmed my bad ideas into it.

```
My intuition: "This feels wrong"
Bot: "Parameters met. Executing."
Result: Loss

My intuition: "Maybe I should wait"  
Bot: "Signal detected. Buying."
Result: Bought the top

My intuition: "This is a fake breakout"
Bot: "Breakout confirmed. All in."
Result: Liquidated
```

The bot didn't remove my bad judgment—it **automated** my bad judgment. It executed my flawed logic faster than I ever could.

**What I Learned:**

Automating stupidity just makes you stupid faster. The problem was never emotions—it was the strategy.

**Cost:** More than the timing losses. The bot was efficient at losing money.

## Mistake #3: The BluntzLoinz Debacle

### Working Inside a Failing Project

After two expensive lessons, I thought: maybe I should be on the *other* side. Help build something instead of just betting on it.

That's how I became a **partial developer** on a project called **BluntzLoinz**.

Yes. That was the real name. No, I didn't choose it.

### What BluntzLoinz Was (Supposedly)

- Cannabis-adjacent cryptocurrency
- Loyalty rewards for dispensaries  
- "The future of legal weed commerce"

I joined because:
1. The tech seemed achievable
2. I wanted to learn from the inside
3. I was naive

### What I Saw From Inside

Being inside a failing crypto project is like watching a slow-motion car crash from the passenger seat.

**The Discord Evolution:**

*Month 1:*
> "We're building something revolutionary! The team is working 24/7!"

*Month 3:*
> "Small delay on the roadmap. We want to do this right."

*Month 6:*
> "We're pivoting to a better opportunity. This is actually bullish."

*Month 9:*
> "The FUD is coordinated. Real believers know the truth."

*Month 12:*
> [Server archived]

### The Psychology I Witnessed

From inside, I watched how believers became defenders:

1. **Early believers** had genuine excitement
2. **First doubters** were labeled "impatient"
3. **Persistent doubters** were labeled "FUD spreaders"
4. **People who left** were labeled "weak hands"
5. **Those who stayed** became entrenched
6. **By the end**, only true believers remained

The skeptics didn't get convinced—they got *exhausted* and left. The believers didn't get smarter—they got more *defensive*.

### The Rug

It wasn't dramatic. No sudden announcement. Just... slow deflation.

Updates stopped. Discord went quiet. Website went down. One day the token had value; six months later it didn't.

**What I Learned:**

The rug doesn't have to be sudden. Sometimes it's just abandonment dressed as "development delays."

And the warning signs were obvious—from the inside. But the people most invested couldn't see them. Or wouldn't.

**Cost:** Mostly time. Which might be worse than money.

## Mistake #4: The Conversation I Lost

### Watching Youchef Get Captured

After BluntzLoinz, I was done. Three strikes. No more crypto investments.

Then Youchef found SchlockFAG.

He was excited. "You have to see this project. It's different. They have sports partnerships. They've raised hundreds of millions."

I asked questions:

---

**The GitHub Conversation:**

**Me:** "Have you looked at their GitHub?"

**Youchef:** "They keep it private for security."

**Me:** "But how do you know the tech works?"

**Youchef:** "They've had audits."

**Me:** "Which auditors? Where's the report?"

**Youchef:** "Do your own research if you don't believe me."

---

**The Counter Conversation:**

**Me:** "I checked Wayback Machine. The counter reset from $50M to $20M."

**Youchef:** "Different batches."

**Me:** "But the numbers don't add up—"

**Youchef:** "Why are you so determined to find problems?"

---

**The Whitepaper Conversation:**

**Me:** "Some sections look copied from other projects."

**Youchef:** "All blockchains build on similar concepts."

**Me:** "No, I mean *literally* copied—"

**Youchef:** "Why are you always so negative?"

---

### The Moment I Stopped

There's a moment when you realize: they don't want to hear it.

Every fact was met with dismissal. Every concern was "FUD." Every question meant I "didn't believe."

So I stopped asking. I just watched.

**What I Saw:**

- The excitement phase
- The defense phase
- The "any day now" phase
- The anger phase
- The quiet phase
- The realization phase

I watched it all. In real-time. Over months.

**What I Learned:**

You can't save someone who's not ready to hear you. They have to see it themselves.

**Cost:** A friendship that's not quite the same anymore.

## Why These Mistakes Matter

I'm not telling you this for sympathy. I'm telling you because:

**Everything I describe in this series, I learned the hard way.**

- I know how timing psychology works because I fell for it
- I know how automation doesn't fix bad strategy because I built one
- I know what it looks like inside a failing project because I was there
- I know how believers defend and attackers get dismissed because I tried to warn someone

When I describe SchlockFAG's playbook, I'm not theorizing. I'm describing patterns I've seen from every angle.

## The Credentials of Failure

I don't have credentials that impress people:
- No finance degree
- No successful trading record
- No viral call that made me famous

I have something different: **I've been wrong enough times to recognize wrong.**

That's the only qualification that matters here.
