Scope,Parameter,Value,Notes
Objective,Goal,Launch survivability + long-term supply discipline,"No price guarantees, no linear vesting overhangs"
Principle,Core rule,Market decides release; time decides review,"Time = option, not entitlement"
Phase 0 – Solvency TGE,TGE unlock,3% (one-time),Price discovery + liquidity anchoring
Phase 0 – Solvency TGE,Auto-staking,Optional,"Incentivized, not mandatory"
Phase 0 – Solvency TGE,Hard cliff,90 days,No additional releases
Phase 0 – Solvency TGE,Principle,Day-one sell pressure < liquidity,Launch survivability
Phase 1 – Observation (Day 0–90),Vesting,0%,No vesting releases
Phase 1 – Observation (Day 0–90),Mining,"Active, constrained",≥70% rewards locked
Phase 1 – Observation (Day 0–90),Dynamic controls,Price↓ → emissions↓; Liquidity↓ → lock ratios↑,State-driven adjustment
Phase 1 – Observation (Day 0–90),Objective,Real market signals replace speculation,
Phase 2 – Hybrid Emission Framework,Start,From Day 91,
Global Hard Caps,Max new circulating supply / month,0.3–1.0%,Vesting + mining + bonus combined
Global Hard Caps,Negative market trend,0% release,Automatic pause
Global Hard Caps,DAO authority,Parameter tuning only,Caps cannot be increased
Emission Logic A – State-Driven (~75%),Governance inputs,30-day VWAP; liquidity growth; staking,
Emission Logic A – State-Driven (~75%),Monthly entitlement,None,Paused releases expire
Emission Logic A – State-Driven (~75%),Accumulation,Not allowed,No catch-up
Emission Logic B – Time-Oriented Review (~25%),Review window,Every 12 months,
Emission Logic B – Time-Oriented Review (~25%),Max allowance,0.1–0.2% / month,Only if caps respected
Emission Logic B – Time-Oriented Review (~25%),Unused allowance,Expires,Not carried forward
Bonus Tokens,Classification,Not exit capital,Structurally subordinate
Bonus Tokens,Release rate,0.05–0.1% / month,Only after Base + Mining
Bonus Tokens,Mandatory lock,≥70%,"Fixed, non-shortenable"
Bonus Tokens,Acceleration / entitlement,None,"No catch-up, no guarantees"
Bonus Tokens,Cap treatment,Counts toward global cap,
Mining,Liquid portion,30–40%,
Mining,Locked portion,40–50%,
Mining,Performance portion,10–20%,
Mining,Minting policy,No volume-based minting,Anti-manipulation
Mining,Cap treatment,Counts toward global cap,
Price Logic,Price targets,None,Narrative only
Price Logic,Above band,Releases may accelerate,
Price Logic,Below band,Automatic pauses,"Signal, not trigger"
Bottom Line,Overhang risk,None,No hidden inflation
Bottom Line,Supply limit,Market absorption capacity,Hard constraint
Bottom Line,Positioning,Survivability + credibility,No false promises
