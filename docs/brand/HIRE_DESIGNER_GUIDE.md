# Logo Design Brief: BlockDAG Phoenix (Cryptocurrency)

## Project Overview
I'm launching BlockDAG Phoenix (BDP), an open-source cryptocurrency 
that combines DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) blockchain technology with 
smart contracts. I need a professional logo and complete brand identity.

## Core Concept
**Phoenix rising from a wireframe cube structure**

The phoenix represents rebirth and transformation. The wireframe cube 
represents our DAG blockchain structure (multiple interconnected blocks 
working in parallel).

## Visual Style
- **Aesthetic**: Minimal, clean, Google-inspired simplicity
- **Modern**: Geometric shapes, not realistic illustrations
- **Tech-forward**: Professional, trustworthy, innovative
- **Unique**: Must stand out from other crypto projects

## Key Elements

### 1. Phoenix (Bird)
- Stylized, geometric (NOT realistic)
- Rising/ascending motion (wings upward)
- Abstract flame or energy effect (optional)
- Should feel powerful but minimal

### 2. Cube (DAG Structure)
- Wireframe/outlined (NOT solid)
- Transparent interior showing structure
- 2x2 or 3x3 block grid
- Represents interconnected blockchain nodes
- Should look technical but clean

## Color Palette

**Primary Colors**:
- Phoenix Orange: #FF6B35
- Phoenix Red: #FF4500 (accents)
- Sky Blue: #4A90E2 (cube/technical elements)

**Supporting Colors**:
- Dark Gray: #1A1A1A (text)
- White: #FFFFFF (background)

**Usage**: 
- Phoenix = Orange/red gradient
- Cube outline = Blue
- Clean white background

## Typography
- Font: Space Grotesk (or similar geometric sans-serif)
- Text: "BlockDAG Phoenix" or just "Phoenix"
- Weight: Bold/Semibold
- Style: Modern, clean, tech-appropriate

## Design References / Inspiration

**Competitor's Cube (BlockDAG)**: 
They use a solid, opaque cube. OURS should be:
- Wireframe/outlined (showing transparency)
- Phoenix emerging from it (showing transformation/rebirth)
- More open and innovative feeling

**Style References**:
- Google's minimal design language
- Ethereum's professional logo aesthetic
- Modern fintech/crypto brands (clean, trustworthy)

**What to AVOID**:
- Overly complex illustrations
- Cartoon/playful style
- Generic stock phoenix images
- Busy backgrounds
- Too many colors
