## Technical Actions

### Step 1: Verify Contract Address

**For Ethereum/BSC tokens:**

1. **Check on Etherscan/BscScan:**
   ```
   https://etherscan.io/token/[CONTRACT_ADDRESS]
   https://bscscan.com/token/[CONTRACT_ADDRESS]
   ```

2. **Look for:**
   - Token name: Should NOT be "BlockDAG"
   - Creator address: Check if it's yours
   - Total supply: Compare to your tokenomics
   - Holder distribution: If one address has 90%+ = scam

3. **Verify ownership:**
   - Check if creator address matches your team
   - If not → It's fake

### Step 2: Check Token Details

**On-chain verification:**

```solidity
// Check token name
token.name() → Should NOT be "BlockDAG"

// Check symbol
token.symbol() → Should NOT be "BDAG"

// Check total supply
token.totalSupply() → Compare to your specs

// Check creator balance
balanceOf(creator) → If >50% = scam
```

### Step 3: Monitor Blockchain

**Set up alerts:**
- New token deployments with "BlockDAG" name
- Large transfers from creator wallet
- Exchange listings
- Social media mentions

**Tools:**
- Etherscan alerts
- Dune Analytics queries
- Twitter/X monitoring bots
