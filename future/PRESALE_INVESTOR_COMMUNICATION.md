# Presale Investor Communication: The 2% Unlock Strategy

**Status**: Ready for Distribution  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Target Audience**: All Presale Participants

---

## Executive Summary

To achieve a successful launch at $0.05 per BDAG with $32 million in liquidity, we must implement an aggressive vesting schedule. This means only **2% of your base coins (340M of 17B total) will unlock at launch**, with the remaining 98% vesting over 5-8 years.

**The Math**: $32M ÷ $0.05 = 640M tokens maximum circulating supply. With 50B total presale tokens, only 1.28% can be unlocked at launch. We're allocating 2% of base coins to give you immediate value while protecting long-term price stability.

## Why This Is Necessary

### The Alternative Scenarios

| Scenario | Unlock % | Launch Price | Your 1M Tokens Value |
|----------|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Aggressive Unlock** | 100% | $0.001 | $1,000 |
| **Moderate Unlock** | 20% | $0.005 | $1,000 |
| **Controlled Unlock** | **2%** | **$0.05** | **$1,000** |

**Key Insight**: You get the same dollar value at launch either way, but with controlled unlock, you still have 980,000 tokens vesting that could be worth $49,000+ if price holds.

### Real-World Precedent: Sui Network

Sui launched with:
- ~5% circulating supply
- Aggressive 4-year vesting
- Launch price: $0.10
- Peak price: $5+ (50x)
- Current price: $1.50+ (15x from launch)

**BlockDAG is MORE aggressive** (2% vs 5%), but the principle is proven: controlled supply = price stability = long-term value.

## How Mining Hardware Helps

Your mining hardware provides additional token access **outside** the vesting schedule:

### Mining as Your Unlock Mechanism

| Miner | Daily Output | Monthly Output | Annual Output |
|-------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| X1 | 20 BDAG | 600 BDAG | 7,200 BDAG |
| X10 | 200 BDAG | 6,000 BDAG | 72,000 BDAG |
| X30 | 600 BDAG | 18,000 BDAG | 216,000 BDAG |
| X100 | 2,000 BDAG | 60,000 BDAG | 720,000 BDAG |

**Example**: If you have an X30 miner:
- Year 1 mining: 216,000 BDAG
- At $0.05: $10,800 value
- This is **in addition** to your vesting schedule

**Early Miner Advantage**: Mining emissions start at 10% rate and ramp to 100% over 12 months. Early miners get first-mover advantage.

## Staking: Double Your 2% Unlock

### Early Staking Bonus (First 90 Days)

Stake your 2% unlock for 12 months and earn **100% APY**:

- **Your 2%**: 20,000 BDAG
- **Stake for 12 months**: Earn 20,000 BDAG rewards
- **Total after 1 year**: 40,000 BDAG (effectively 4% unlocked)

### Staking Tiers

| Lock Period | APY | Your 20K BDAG After 1 Year |
|-------------|-----|----------------------------|
| 30 days | 8% | 21,600 BDAG |
| 90 days | 15% | 23,000 BDAG |
| 180 days | 25% | 25,000 BDAG |
| **365 days** | **40%** | **28,000 BDAG** |

**Recommendation**: Stake your 2% for 12 months to effectively double your immediate unlock.

---

## Loyalty Multiplier Program

**Don't sell any tokens for 6 months** = 1.5x multiplier on your next unlock phase.

**Example**:
- Your Phase 1 unlock: 80,000 BDAG
- With loyalty multiplier: 120,000 BDAG
- **Extra value**: $2,000 at $0.05

---

## DAO Governance: You Control the Pace

The bonus coin releases (33B tokens) are **DAO-controlled**. This means:

1. **You vote** on when to release each phase
2. **Milestone accelerators** can unlock bonus coins early if:
   - Market cap reaches $100M, $250M, $500M, $1B
   - TVL reaches $50M, $100M, $250M
   - Network grows to 100K, 500K, 1M active wallets
   - All hardware is delivered
   - Major exchange listings occur

**Your locked tokens still vote**: Even though they're locked, you have full governance power.

## Emergency Protections

We've built automatic safeguards to protect your investment:

### Price Protection

- If price drops below $0.02 for 7 days → **All vesting pauses automatically**
- Unlocks resume only when price recovers to $0.03+

### Liquidity Protection

- If liquidity drops below $10M → **All vesting pauses automatically**
- Unlocks resume when liquidity recovers to $15M+

**These protections ensure** that massive dumps can't crash the price before you get your tokens.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why only 2%? That seems unfair.

**A**: The math is unforgiving. With $32M liquidity, we can only support 640M circulating tokens. If we unlock more, price crashes to $0.001 and your tokens become worthless. 2% at $0.05 = same dollar value as 100% at $0.001, but you keep 98% for future value.

### Q: What if I need to sell immediately?

**A**: You can sell your 2% unlock immediately. However, we strongly recommend staking it for 12 months to double it. If you absolutely must sell, the loyalty multiplier program rewards those who hold.

### Q: Can the vesting schedule change?

**A**: The base coin schedule (5 years) is immutable. Bonus coins (8 years) can be accelerated by DAO vote if milestones are achieved. The schedule can be **paused** by emergency brake but cannot be made more aggressive without your vote.

### Q: What happens if price crashes anyway?

**A**: Emergency brake activates automatically, pausing all unlocks. This prevents further sell pressure. Price must recover before unlocks resume.

### Q: How do I claim my tokens?

**A**: At launch, visit the vesting portal, connect your wallet, and claim your 2% base coins. Future unlocks will be claimable monthly as they vest.

### Q: What about my mining rewards?

**A**: Mining rewards are separate from vesting. However, 50% of mining rewards must be staked for 90 days (this protects price). You get immediate access to the other 50%.

### Q: Can I transfer my locked tokens?

**A**: Locked tokens are non-transferable until unlocked. However, you can transfer your claim rights (the right to claim future unlocks) if needed.

## The Bottom Line

**This is the most aggressive vesting schedule in recent crypto history**, but it's mathematically necessary for a $0.05 launch.

**Your options**:
1. **Accept 2% unlock** → Get $1,000 at launch, $49,000+ vesting over 5-8 years
2. **Stake your 2%** → Double it to 4% effective unlock
3. **Use mining hardware** → Generate additional tokens outside vesting
4. **Participate in DAO** → Vote to accelerate bonus releases

**The alternative**: 100% unlock at $0.001 = $1,000 total value, no future upside.
